There was a distinctive Provençal liturgy, used by the Jews of the Papal enclave of Comtat Venaissin, who remained following the expulsion of the Jews from the rest of France. This liturgy was intermediate in character between the Sephardi and Ashkenazi rites, and was in some ways closer to the Italian rite than to either.

The curve has a U-like shape, superficially similar in appearance to a parabola, but it is not a parabola: it is a (scaled, rotated) graph of the hyperbolic cosine. The curve appears in the design of certain types of arches and as a cross section of the catenoid—the shape assumed by a soap film bounded by two parallel circular rings. The catenary is also called the alysoid, chainette, or, particularly in the material sciences, funicular. Mathematically, the catenary curve is the graph of the hyperbolic cosine function. The surface of revolution of the catenary curve, the catenoid, is a minimal surface, specifically a minimal surface of revolution. The mathematical properties of the catenary curve were first studied by Robert Hooke in the 1670s, and its equation was derived by Leibniz, Huygens and Johann Bernoulli in 1691. Catenaries and related curves are used in architecture and engineering, in the design of bridges and arches, so that forces do not result in bending moments. In the offshore oil and gas industry, \"catenary\" refers to a steel catenary riser, a pipeline suspended between a production platform and the seabed that adopts an approximate catenary shape.'], ['Vladyslav Mykulyak', 'Vladyslav Mykulyak (Ukrainian: Владислав Степанович Микуляк; born 30 August 1984 in Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union) is a professional Ukrainian footballer who currently plays for Várda SE.'], ['West Covina Family Dentistry', \"S.

Before big races, Woodcock would sleep outside Phar Lap\\'s stable, and it was said that Phar Lap refused food from anyone but Tommy. Following on from Phar Lap\\'s defeat in the 1931 Melbourne Cup the horse was shipped to America, where he competed in and won the Agua Caliente Handicap. Shortly afterwards, on 5 April 1932, Phar Lap died suddenly. Ever the devoted strapper, Woodcock was with him in his final moments. Woodcock continued to work with horses until his retirement in 1983. In his later years he achieved fame through training Reckless. In 1977, with Reckless he won the Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane Cups all in the same year and ran second in the Melbourne Cup. Tommy Woodcock died at Yarrawonga on 27 April 1985, aged 79, where he was cared for in his last years by his lifelong friends, the Hinchliffe family.

He was a senior Sahaba of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He succeeded Abu Bakr (632–634) as the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate on 23 August 634. He was an expert Islamic jurist known for his pious and just nature, which earned him the epithet Al-Farooq (\"the one who distinguishes between right and wrong\"). He is sometimes referred to as Umar I by historians of Islam, since a later Umayyad caliph, Umar II, also bore that name. According to Sunnis, Umar is the second greatest of the Sahaba after Abu Bakr. Under Umar, the caliphate expanded at an unprecedented rate, ruling the Sasanian Empire and more than two-thirds of the Byzantine Empire. His attacks against the Sasanian Empire resulted in the conquest of Persia in fewer than two years (642–644).

Thus it was named the Royal Suédois. As a special privilege granted by the King of France, the regiment was allowed to only accept Swedish officers. However most of the privates and NCOs were of German origin, from Swedish Pomerania, in view of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient numbers of Swedish recruits, and at least one Irishman, Daniel Charles, Count O'Connell, was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the regiment. Initially named the Lenck Regiment, the unit was renamed the Appelgrehn Regiment in 1734 and the Royal-Suedois in 1742. From about 1750 onwards the regiment was distinguished by wearing dark blue coats with buff (yellow-brown) collars and cuffs. This colour combination matched the uniform of most infantry regiments in the Swedish Army during the 17th and 18th centuries. Count Axel von Fersen purchased the position of colonel-proprietor of the regiment in 1783, according to some in order to be able to stay close to the Queen of France Marie Antoinette. He remained in active command of the regiment until the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, and officially this was still the case when, in 1791, all royal foreign regiments were disbanded. The regiment was then reorganised as the new 89th Regiment of the Line. In December 1813, the regiment was once again raised by a French émigré in Germany, and it fought in the Swedish Army during the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 and during the campaign in Norway in 1814. The Royal Suédois was finally disbanded in December 1814 in Norway. Today, the regiment's traditions and flag are carried on in the French Army via a company in the 4th Infantry Regiment.\"], ['The Model Garage', \"We are an independent Berkeley auto repair shop which specializes in Volvo, Toyota and Lexus including hybrids such as Prius, and Scion repair.

They were managed by Jim Williams and played its home games at the Estadio BR Julio Hernández Molina in Acarigua, Portuguesa. This team was created by the temporary merger of two VPBL teams, the Tiburones de La Guaira and the Leones del Caracas, at the end of the 1974–1975 season. By then, the Tiburones and Leones management had a contract dispute with the Central University of Venezuela, owners of the Estadio Universitario in Caracas, which was shared by both teams. As a result, both teams moved out of Caracas and temporarily merged their operations into a single team, a curious development, since the two teams were historically bitter rivals of the fan base who settled in the same area. Meanwhile, fans in La Guaira and Caracas cities loathed the Tibuleones nickname to identify the new squad, which is a reminiscent of the ludicrous 1914–1915 Federal League nicknames (Buf-Feds) and the National Football League (Card-Pitt) monikers during World War II conflict. The Tibuleones sobriquet derived from the Tiburones (Sharks) and Leones (Lions) words, creating a term that could be translated as Sharklions. The team finished second with a 33-31 record, four games behind regular-season winner Cardenales de Lara, but was swept by the Tigres de Aragua, 4–0, in the first round playoff series.

In July 1995 the group was strengthened by the joining of eleven deputies: all former members of Lega Nord, who had previously joined the Federalist Italian League and the Federalists and Liberal Democrats. This made possible the establishment of a sub-group within the Mixed Group in the Chamber. The party was officially founded, changing its denomination, on 17 December 1995. At the founding congress in Milan also Vittorio Sgarbi, art critic and maverick politician, joined the party. The program of the party included the idea of transforming Italy in a federal State, modelled onto the examples of Switzerland and the United States, composed by three cantons (Padania, Etruria and Mediterranea) and the five existing autonomous regions. The federation would have been presided by a strong President. For the 1996 general election Sgarbi left Miglio to form a list with Marco Pannella, the Pannella-Sgarbi List.

According to Hesiod\\'s Theogony, Triton dwelt with his parents in a golden palace in the depths of the sea; Homer places his seat in the waters off Aegae.[disambiguation needed] The story of the Argonauts places his home on the coast of Libya.

When the Argonauts were lost in the desert, he guided them to find the passage from the river back to the sea. Triton was the father of Pallas and foster parent to the goddess Athena.

The experiments began in July 1961, in the basement of Linsly-Chittenden Hall at Yale University, three months after the start of the trial of German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem.

The name Alan is an Iranian dialectical form of Aryan, a common self-designation of the Indo-Iranians. Possibly related to the Massagetae, the Alans have been connected by modern historians with the Central Asian Yancai and Aorsi of Chinese and Roman sources respectively. Having migrated westwards and become dominant among the Sarmatians on the Pontic Steppe, they are mentioned by Persian and Roman sources in the 1st century AD. At the time they had settled the region north of the Black Sea, and frequently raided the Parthian Empire and the Caucasian provinces of the Roman Empire. In 215-250 AD their power on the Pontic Steppe was broken by the Goths. Upon the Hunnic defeat of the Goths on the Pontic Steppe around 375 AD, many of the Alans migrated westwards along with various Germanic tribes. They crossed the Rhine in 406 AD along with the Vandals and Suebi, settling in Orléans and Valence. Around 409 AD they joined the Vandals and Suebi in the crossing of the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula, settling in Lusitania and Carthaginiensis. The Iberian Alans were soundly defeated by the Visigoths 418 AD, and subsequently surrendered their authority to the Hasdingi Vandals. In 428 AD, the Vandals and Alans crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into North Africa, where they founded a powerful kingdom which lasted until its conquest by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century AD. The Alans who remained under Hunnic rule founded a powerful kingdom in the North Caucasus in the Middle Ages, which ended with the Mongol invasions in the 13th century AD.

While there is not much verifiable information regarding Hilarion's biography, there are several aspects of his life which have come to be generally accepted. According to the Primary Chronicle Hilarion served as a priest or monk in the princely residence of Berestovo (Berestov) near the Rus' capital of Kiev. He acquired the reputation of well-educated scholar and upon the death of Metropolitan Theopemptus in 1049, Hilarion was proclaimed the metropolitan of Kiev by Yaroslav the Wise, the Grand prince of Kiev, who thus challenged the old Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Hilarion's appointment met with stiff opposition from Luka Zhidiata, Bishop of Novgorod (r. 1035-1060). Zhidyata openly opposed probably because it was the prerogative of the Patriarch of Constantinople to appoint the Kievan metropolitan and thus Hilarion's appointment was uncanonical. For his opposition, Luka was confined in the Kievan Caves Monastery for three years until his death, at which time his remains were taken back to Novgorod and buried in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom there. It appears as though Hilarion did not serve an extended term as the Kievan metropolitan, as some chronicles began mentioning Metropolitan Yefrem in 1055. Nevertheless, Hilarion remains the best known of all the ancient Kievan metropolitans, not only because he was the first native to ascend to that position, but also because of his writings. Hilarion is credited as the author of four works:\"], ['Lockton Companies', 'Founded in 1966, Lockton Companies is one of the largest insurance brokerage firms in the country.

He is best known for his work on the Wallace & Gromit films and Peppa Pig animations. Nott was educated at Eton College and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford where he studied Music and Philosophy, Politics and Economics and was the college organ scholar. After a few years working for Arthur Andersen Management Consultants in the City (now Accenture) and writing freelance for The Economist Group, he enrolled at the British National Film and Television School. There, he met the creator of the Wallace and Gromit series, Nick Park. They both received recognition for the work they did there, including Park\\'s student film A Grand Day Out. After leaving the National Film and Television School, Nott worked for a number of years as a documentary film-maker, making films for Channel Four Television and other broadcasters until he gradually switched to a career in television and film composing.

The ABC's priority is debated among historians of computer technology, because it was not programmable, nor Turing-complete. Many credit John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, creators of the ENIAC, which came into use in July 1946, with the title. Others cite the programmable British Colossus computer which was demonstrated to be working on December 8, 1943. Some historians argue that the credit undisputedly belongs to Iowa State mathematics and physics professor John Vincent Atanasoff for his work with the ABC, with the help of graduate student Clifford Berry. Conceived in 1937, the machine was not programmable, being designed only to solve systems of linear equations. It was successfully tested in 1942. However, its intermediate result storage mechanism, a paper card writer/reader, was unreliable, and when John Vincent Atanasoff left Iowa State College for World War II assignments, work on the machine was discontinued. The ABC pioneered important elements of modern computing, including binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements, but its special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable, stored program distinguish it from modern computers. The computer was designated an IEEE Milestone in 1990. Atanasoff and Berry's computer work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the 1960s, amidst conflicting claims about the first instance of an electronic computer. At that time, the ENIAC was considered to be the first computer in the modern sense, but in 1973 a U.S. District Court invalidated the ENIAC patent and concluded that the ENIAC inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from Atanasoff (see ).\"], [\"Maureen O'Hara\", \"Born Maureen FitzSimons, on August 17, 1920, in Ranelagh, Ireland.

Originally released for the NES, Final Fantasy was remade for several video game consoles and is frequently packaged with Final Fantasy II in video game collections.

Together, they quest to defeat these evil forces, restore light to the orbs, and save their world.

Little is known about his life, aside from his short term as Governor during the turbulent early days of company rule. When the rule of Gabriel Milan, and his imprisonment of former Governor Adolph Esmit had become a problem for the Danish West India Company in 1686, it was decided that Mikkelsen was to be sent as a commissioner to settle the difficulties. Mikkelsen left Copenhagen on 15 October 1685, arriving fully armed on 24 February 1686 on board the same Fortuna that had brought Milan to St. Thomas. In the meantime, Milan, warned from Copenhagen by his son Ferdinand, had secured (or \"cajoled\" as Westergaard puts it ) the plantationers of St. Thomas into putting up resistance against Mikkelsen, the \"rascal\". A three-day parley followed, as Mikkelsen attempted to negotiate with an armed Milan. Finally, after making it clear to Milan that his actions could cause him to be held liable for rebellion, and that his mean were leaving him, Mikkelsen managed to talk him to returning to Copenhagen. Esmit and his wife, along with others of Milan\\'s prisoners were extracted from the prison and boarded the Fortuna along with Milan. Mikkelsen\\'s task was now to collect evidence of Milan\\'s misconduct for the trial in Copenhagen, and acted as de facto Governor of the island from this day. According to exchanges with West India Company Director Albert Gyllensparre, the proceedings were quite heated, as both Esmit and Milan would accuse each other, shouting and screaming. On 29 June 1686, they started making preparations to return to Copenhagen, and Christopher Heins was inserted as Governor-General.

For fifteen years in DC Comics continuity, she was also his wife. Like Superman's alter ego Clark Kent, she is a reporter for the Metropolis newspaper, the Daily Planet. The character was created from many influences. Her physical appearance was originally based on Joanne Carter, a model hired by Superman co-creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and Siegel's future wife. Siegel based Lois' personality on Torchy Blane—a gutsy, beautiful, and headline-hunting reporter, portrayed by Glenda Farrell in a series of 1930s films.

During the Silver Age of Comics, she was the star of Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, a comic series that had a light and frivolous tone. The original Golden Age version of Lois Lane, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a tough-as-nails journalist and intellectual equal to Superman.

Born in Hamburg, Schleiden was educated at Heidelberg, then practiced law in Hamburg, but soon developed his love for the botany into a full-time pursuit. Schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope. While a professor of botany at the University of Jena, he wrote Contributions to Phytogenesis (1838), in which he stated that the different parts of the plant organism are composed of cells. Thus, Schleiden and Schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry. He also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus, discovered in 1831 by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, and sensed its connection with cell division. Schleiden was one of the first German biologists to accept Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. He became professor of botany at the University of Dorpat in 1863.He concluded that all plant parts are made of cells and that an embryonic plant organism arises from the one cell.He died in Frankfurt am Main on 23 June 1881.\"], [\"Deborah's Mobile Archery Range\", \"We run archery certification trainings and group lessons.

One of the fundamental concepts investigated is the Gaussian curvature, first studied in depth by Carl Friedrich Gauss (), who showed that curvature was an intrinsic property of a surface, independent of its isometric embedding in Euclidean space. Surfaces naturally arise as graphs of functions of a pair of variables, and sometimes appear in parametric form or as loci associated to space curves. An important role in their study has been played by Lie groups (in the spirit of the Erlangen program), namely the symmetry groups of the Euclidean plane, the sphere and the hyperbolic plane. These Lie groups can be used to describe surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature; they also provide an essential ingredient in the modern approach to intrinsic differential geometry through connections. On the other hand extrinsic properties relying on an embedding of a surface in Euclidean space have also been extensively studied. This is well illustrated by the non-linear Euler–Lagrange equations in the calculus of variations: although Euler developed the one variable equations to understand geodesics, defined independently of an embedding, one of Lagrange's main applications of the two variable equations was to minimal surfaces, a concept that can only be defined in terms of an embedding.\"], ['Clarence Lieder', 'Clarence Lieder (August 15, 1906-January 1969) was a mechanic and armorer for Chicago\\'s underworld and Depression-era criminals, as well as the primary competitor to Joe Bergl.

Allis is best known for deciphering regulatory mechanisms that impinge upon the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin and for identifying the responsible enzyme systems that govern the covalent modifications of histone proteins, the principal components that organize chromatin. Allis discovered the critical link, through histone acetyltransferase-containing transcriptional coactivators, between targeted histone acetylation and gene-specific transcriptional activation. In further studies, he linked histone phosphorylation events to mitosis and mitogen action, established a synergy between histone phosphorylation and acetylation events and elaborated the ‘histone code hypothesis’ (and extensions thereof), one of the most highly cited theories governing epigenetics. Implications of this research for human biology and human disease, notably cancer, are far-reaching and continuing at a remarkable pace.'], ['James Jones', \"James Jones\\nSignature\\nJames Jones was born in 1734.

He retained, however, his family-name Piso. Piso had attained some importance as early as the first civil war. On the death of Lucius Cornelius Cinna, in 84 BC, he married his wife Annia, and in the following year, 83, was appointed quaestor to the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio. But he quickly deserted this party, and went over to Sulla, who compelled him to divorce his wife on account of her previous connection with Cinna. Piso was the father of Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi, a Roman politician who may have been praetor in 44 BC and could have been a legatus in 40 BC. His grandson may have been Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives, consul of 14 BC. He failed in obtaining the aedileship, and the year of his praetorship is uncertain. After his praetorship he received the province of Spain with the title of proconsul, and on his return to Rome in 69 BC, enjoyed the honour of a triumph, although it was asserted by some that he had no claim to this distinction. Piso served in the Third Mithridatic War as a legatus of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, who sent him to Rome in 62, to become a candidate for the consulship, as he was anxious to obtain the ratification of his acts in Asia, and therefore wished to have one of his friends at the head of the state. Piso was accordingly elected consul for the following year, 61 with Marcus Valerius Messalla Niger. In his consulship he gave great offense to Cicero, by not asking him first in the senate for his opinion, and still further increased the anger of the orator by taking Publius Clodius under his protection after his violation of the mysteries of the Bona Dea. Cicero revenged himself on Piso, by preventing him from obtaining the province of Syria, which had been promised to him. Piso must have died, in all probability, before 47 BC, for in 47 BC Marcus Antonius inhabited his house at Rome.'], ['Diana Nasser', \"- Born In Lebanon, I graduated from Saint Joseph University-USJ with a Bachelor Degree in Business Management and then joined ESA Business School where I earned my Master's Degree in International Management in 2006.\\n- Earlier that year, I had the chance to join a new born newspaper called 'Al Akhbar', a daily political in Arabic language which soon became one of the most important newspapers in the country if not the first.

Although digital representations are the subject matter of discrete mathematics, the information represented can be either discrete, such as numbers and letters, or it can be continuous, such as sounds, images, and other measurements. The word digital comes from the same source as the words digit and digitus (the Latin word for finger), as fingers are often used for discrete counting. Mathematician George Stibitz of Bell Telephone Laboratories used the word digital in reference to the fast electric pulses emitted by a device designed to aim and fire anti-aircraft guns in 1942.

Michael was a board member of International Rhino Foundation (IRF), and used the organizational structure and business plan of IRF as a template for multiple elephant holding facilities with diverse missions to come together for a shared common goal of contributing to the long-term preservation of elephants. In November 1998, Michael invited nine representatives from zoos, private elephant facilities, circuses and a university to Fort Worth, Texas to discuss how a foundation could significantly enhance current conservation efforts. From this first organizational meeting the International Elephant Foundation was born.

It originated in the late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of Carl Menger, Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser, and others. It was methodologically opposed to the Prussian Historical School (a dispute known as Methodenstreit). Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries, but their work is referred to as Austrian economics. Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the subjective theory of value, marginalism in price theory, and the formulation of the economic calculation problem, each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics. Many economists are critical of the current-day Austrian School and consider its rejection of econometrics and aggregate macroeconomic analysis to be outside of mainstream economic theory, or \"heterodox.\" Austrians are likewise critical of mainstream economics. Although the Austrian School has been considered heterodox since the late 1930s, it began to attract renewed academic and public interest starting in the 1970s.'], ['Durkin, Kimberly', \"Advanced Academic Specialist for Walt Disney Elementary.\\nI received my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Elementary Education with a minor in Psychology\\nfrom Morningside College in Sioux City, IA.\\nI then moved to Maryland where I taught for 1 year before moving to Colorado.\\nIn Colorado I taught for 2 years before finally moving to Alvin, Texas where we now call home.\\nI have three wonderful children.

Millikan (March 22, 1868 – December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for his measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect. Millikan graduated from Oberlin College in 1891 and obtained his doctorate at Columbia University in 1895. In 1896 he became an assistant at the University of Chicago, where he became a full professor in 1910. In 1909 Millikan began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electric field. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his famous oil-drop experiment in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with oil. In 1914 Millikan took up with similar skill the experimental verification of the equation introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 to describe the photoelectric effect. He used this same research to obtain an accurate value of Planck’s constant. In 1921 Millikan left the University of Chicago to become director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. There he undertook a major study of the radiation that the physicist Victor Hess had detected coming from outer space. Millikan proved that this radiation is indeed of extraterrestrial origin, and he named it \"cosmic rays.\" As chairman of the Executive Council of Caltech (the school\\'s governing body at the time) from 1921 until his retirement in 1945, Millikan helped to turn the school into one of the leading research institutions in the United States.

An Eastern European immigrant himself, Abraham Orwasher opened the store in 1916, and lived in a small apartment in the back. In the basement was a coal fired brick oven, where Orwasher, with a small staff, baked eastern European / Jewish style loaves of pumpernickel, rye bread, challah, and small rolls. It soon became a thriving wholesale business with deliveries being made by horse and buggy. Abraham's son Louis would go on to take over the business from his father, owning the building the bakery was housed in. Louis would go on to perfect the formulas of his father, while reinventing the breads sold. It is claimed that it was Louis who invented Raisin Pumpernickel bread, at Orwasher's during World War II.

Jarrow of Kamakura Corporation and Cornell University and Stuart Turnbull, currently at the University of Houston. Many experts in financial theory label the Jarrow–Turnbull model as the first \"reduced-form\" credit model. Reduced-form models are an approach to credit risk modeling that contrasts sharply with the \"structural credit models\". The structural or \"Merton\" credit models are single-period models which derive the probability of default from the random variation in the unobservable value of the firm\\'s assets. Two years after the development of the structural credit model, Robert Merton modeled bankruptcy as a continuous probability of default. Upon the random occurrence of default, the stock price of the defaulting company is assumed to go to zero. Merton derived the value of options for a company that can default. This was in fact the first \"reduced form\" model where bankruptcy is modeled as a statistical process, rather than as a microeconomic model of the firm\\'s capital structure.[citation needed] The Jarrow–Turnbull model extends the reduced-form model of Merton (1976) to a random interest rates framework. Large financial institutions employ default models of both the structural and reduced form types. The Merton structural default probabilities were first offered by KMV LLC in the early 1990s. KMV LLC was acquired by Moody\\'s Investors Service in 2002. Kamakura Corporation, where Robert Jarrow serves as director of research, has offered both structural and reduced form default probabilities on public companies since 2002.[citation needed]'], ['Imus local elections, 2013', \"Local elections were held in the newly created city of Imus in Cavite on May 13, 2013 in conjunction with the 2013 Philippine midterm elections.

More than a theory of society, Parsons presented a theory of social evolution and a concrete interpretation of the \"drives\" and directions of world history. Parsons analyzed the work of Émile Durkheim and Vilfredo Pareto and evaluated their contributions through the paradigm of voluntaristic action.

Many critics praised her bel canto technique, wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations. Her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto operas of Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini and further, to the works of Verdi and Puccini; and, in her early career, to the music dramas of Wagner.

In 1816 he was appointed head of \\'antiquarian\\' collections which later developed into the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. While organizing and classifying the antiquities for exhibition, he decided to present them chronologically according to the three-age system. Other scholars had previously proposed that prehistory had advanced from an age of stone tools, to ages of tools made from bronze and iron, but these proposals were presented as systems of evolution, which did not allow dating of artifacts. Thomsen refined the three-age system as a chronological system by seeing which artifacts occurred with which other artifacts in closed finds. In this way, he was the first to establish an evidence-based division of prehistory into discrete periods. This achievement led to his being credited as the originator of the three-age system of European antiquity. Thomsen also wrote one of the first systematic treatises on gold bracteates of the Migration period. Thomsen\\'s study of artifacts within the Copenhagen museum were based on associations between stylistic change, decoration and context; he recognised the importance of examining objects from \"closed finds\", allowing him to determine the associations of common artifacts for various periods (stone - bronze - iron). His results were published in the Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed (Guideline to Scandinavian Antiquity) in 1836.

Roman jurists wondered why the ius gentium (the laws which applied to foreigners and citizens alike) was in general accepted by all people living in the Empire. Their conclusion was that these laws made sense to a reasonable person and thus were followed. All laws which would make sense to a normal person were called ius naturale. Slavery for example was part of the empire-wide ius gentium because slavery was known and accepted as a fact in all parts of the known world, nevertheless slavery does not make sense to a reasonable person. Forcing people to work for others was not natural. So, slavery was part of the ius gentium but not of the ius naturale. The ius naturale of the Roman jurists is not the same as implied by the modern sense of natural law as something derived from pure reason. As Sir Henry Sumner Maine puts it, \"it was never thought of as founded on quite untested principles. The notion was that it underlay existing law and must be looked for through it\". Romans gave to Natural law a great importance in their daily lives . They mentioned once\" ius naturale est quo natura omnia animalia docuit\" which means the right that nature gave to all living things.'], ['Finns in Switzerland', 'Finns in Switzerland consist of migrants from Finland to Switzerland and their descendants.

It is a Grade I listed building. The Holbech family acquired the Farnborough estate in 1684 and the honey-coloured two-storey stone house was built soon after. Major changes to the property occurred between 1745 and 1750 when the entrance front was remodelled and the rococo plasterwork was added to the interior. This work was carried out by William Holbech who wanted a suitable setting for the sculpture and art he had brought back from his Grand Tour. He most likely used designs by his close friend Sanderson Miller, an architect, who lived a few miles away. Long Palladian facades with sash windows, pedimented doorways and a balustraded roofline were added to the earlier classical west front. Unlike many of its contemporaries, Farnborough Hall and its landscaped gardens have experienced little alteration in the last 200 years and they remain largely as William Holbech left them. The entrance opens straight into the Italianate hall. The walls are adorned with busts of Roman emperors set into oval niches and the panelled ceiling is stuccoed with rococo motifs. The dining room on the south front was especially designed to display works by Canaletto and Giovanni Paolo Panini. The original works are long gone, being replaced by copies.

Since World War II and the fall of Nazi Germany, only the third stanza has been used as the national anthem. The stanza\\'s beginning, \"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\" (\"Unity and Justice and Freedom\") is considered the unofficial national motto of Germany, and is inscribed on modern German Army belt buckles and the rims of some German coins. The music was written by Austrian composer Joseph Haydn in 1797 as an anthem for the birthday of Francis II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and later of Austria. In 1841, the German linguist and poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the lyrics of \"Das Lied der Deutschen\" to Haydn\\'s melody, lyrics that were considered revolutionary at the time. The song is also well known by the beginning and refrain of the first stanza, \"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles\" (\"Germany, Germany above all\"), but this has never been its title. The line \"Germany, Germany above all\" meant that the most important goal of 19th-century German liberal revolutionaries should be a unified Germany which would overcome the perceived anti-liberal ethos of then-fragmented Germany (Kleinstaaterei). Along with the flag of Germany, it was one of the symbols of the March Revolution of 1848. In order to endorse its republican and liberal tradition, the song was chosen as the national anthem of Germany in 1922, during the Weimar Republic.

She was the younger sister of Anne Marshall, another prominent actress of the period. The younger Marshall sister began acting with the King\\'s Company, under the management of Thomas Killigrew, around 1663; she remained with that troupe for her full career, except for a final year with the rival Duke\\'s Company in 1677. She acted with her sister Anne at least once, in John Dryden\\'s The Maiden Queen in 1664; Anne played Candiope, and Rebecca played the Queen. When her older sister retired from the stage (temporarily) in 1668, Rebecca inherited several of her roles, as Aurelia in Dryden\\'s An Evening\\'s Love and Nourmahal in Aureng-zebe; she may also have inherited the part of Evadne in Beaumont and Fletcher\\'s The Maid\\'s Tragedy. Rebecca Marshall\\'s other roles were: — among other parts, including spoken prologues and epilogues for various dramas. She participated in two of Killigrew\\'s famous all-female productions, of his own The Parson\\'s Wedding and Beaumont and Fletcher\\'s Philaster, both in 1672. Rebecca Marshall formed a \"remarkable acting combination\" with fellow performer Elizabeth Boutell, first in William Joyner\\'s The Roman Empress in 1670. Their success inspired a fashion for plays of \"women in conflict,\" in which Marshall was usually the villainess (or at least the darker half of the pairing), and Boutell the virtuous heroine. They enacted this pattern in The Conquest of Granada, also in 1670: Marshall was Lyndaraxa to Boutell\\'s Bezayda. And again, with Marshall as Poppea and Boutell as Cyara in Nathaniel Lee\\'s The Tragedy of Nero (1674); as Queen Berenice and Clarona in John Crowne\\'s The Destruction of Jerusalem (1677); and as Roxana and Statira in Lee\\'s The Rival Queens (also 1677). The \"women in conflict\" play reached beyond Marshall and Boutell: the rival Duke\\'s Company competed with its own actress pairing, Mary Betterton and Mary Lee; and Elizabeth Barry and Anne Bracegirdle repeated the pattern in the 1680s and \\'90s. In her one season with the Duke\\'s Company, Rebecca Marshall was cast against Barry in a rare comic version of the pattern, in Thomas d\\'Urfey\\'s A Fond Husband, or the Plotting Sisters. Samuel Pepys repeatedly refers to both Marshall sisters in his Diary; he calls the younger \"Beck Marshall.\" Rebecca had a reputation as a beauty, which apparently caused her difficulties: she twice petitioned King Charles II for protection from obstreperous men in her audience. And she had a habit of feuding with Nell Gwyn.'], ['Larry Tanz', 'Larry Tanz is an entertainment industry executive.

Bennett Biscuit Company, which operated a bakery on the Lower East Side of New York City. Originally named Maltoid, the biscuit was a bone-shaped treat made from minerals, meat products, and milk. Sometime between 1915 and 1926, the biscuit was simply named \"Milk-Bone\", owing to the high composition of cow\\'s milk. In 1931, the bakery was acquired by the National Biscuit Company (now Nabisco). The biscuit was the only Bennett product carried over after the acquisition. Over the next few decades, the Milk-Bone was expanded to include a number of different flavors, such as chicken and beef. The marketing focus was also shifted from Milk-Bone being merely a dog treat to a product that promoted cleaner teeth and better breath. Nabisco, under the ownership of Kraft Foods, sold the Milk-Bone rights over to Del Monte Foods of San Francisco, California, in May 2006. The biscuits are made exclusively in Buffalo, New York. A box of Milk-Bone treats makes an early product placement appearance in the 1924 silent film The Tomboy.

The inn, the first public house in the area, was located on the Kings Highway (now Bristol Pike) at the bridge across Poquessing Creek. In 1730, Philip Amos petitioned the court to keep a public house of entertainment \"near Poquessing creek, on the highway from Philadelphia to Bristol, that being The Red Lion Inn\". Delegates to the First Continental Congress from Massachusetts dined there on their way to Philadelphia in 1774. John Adams was known to stop there on his travels to and from Philadelphia. The inn operated from about 1726 until December 1991, when it was destroyed by fire. Many stories surround the inn as it was home to Henrietta, a companion who lived in the upstairs center room.[citation needed] The center room though that floor was not heated was always warmer than either adjoining room. Its interior went through many renovations over its lifetime, but many things were left unchanged such as the grand fireplace in the basement-level meeting room where many meetings were held during the Revolution. It was later known as a stop on the Underground Railroad. General George Washington and the Continental Army camped along the Poquessing behind the Red Lion Inn on their way to Yorktown.

The original crown was destroyed during the ensuing fighting and victory of the Mexican republic, but replicas remain on display. The Imperial Crown of Mexico during Maximilian's reign was modeled on the crowns of France and Austria. The crown of Maximilian's ancestor, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, had two arches which cross over the top of the miter. It is this unique form which appears to have been the model—although, as Napoleon III was the main power behind the Second Mexican Empire, and as an extension of the Second French Empire, the Mexican crown also used the half-arches and eagles on the circlet on the front, back and sides from the Crown of Napoleon.

It was written by sitcom writer Simon Nye and directed by Catherine Morshead. In the episode, lead characters the Doctor, a time travelling alien played by Matt Smith, and his human travelling companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and her fiancé Rory (Arthur Darvill), are in a trap set by the mysterious \"Dream Lord\" (Toby Jones), wherein they repeatedly fall asleep and wake up in a different reality. In one, Amy and Rory are happily married but pursued by elderly people possessed by aliens, while in another they are on board the Doctor\\'s time machine, the TARDIS, where they anticipate being frozen to death by a nearby astronomical phenomenon. They must decide which is the real reality and die in the phony one, to wake up in reality and escape the trap. At the episode\\'s conclusion, the Dream Lord is ultimately revealed to be a manifestation of the Doctor\\'s dark side and self-loathing. Nye wrote the episode to explore and to test Amy\\'s relationships with both the Doctor and Rory. Showrunner Steven Moffat suggested that Nye, a comedy writer by trade, build the episode around a split dream concept, and encouraged Nye to create a \"monster\" for the episode, which influenced his writing of the retirement home dream. The dream scenes in Amy and Rory\\'s village was filmed in Skenfrith, Wales and used CGI and prosthetics. \"Amy\\'s Choice\" was seen by 7.55 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD and received generally mixed reviews from critics. The most positive praised the episode\\'s surrealism and commended it as one of the year\\'s strongest scripts, but other reviewers felt the episode\\'s horror or monsters unsatisfying.'], ['Gerald Fredrick Töben', 'Gerald Fredrick Töben (born 2 June 1944) is a German-born Australian citizen who was director and founder of the Adelaide Institute, a Holocaust denial group in Australia.

Elsbeth was born in Neustadt, Franconia; his birth date is totally unknown, although he did refer to himself as \"poor and old\" in 1616. Since his early publications were issued in Frankfurt an der Oder, he is thought to have been an acquaintance of Bartholomäus Gesius, the kantor there. He may have attended Viadrina University in Frankfurt, though modern scholars have been unable to substantiate this with archival research. He dedicated a publication to the city councilmen of Breslau, and may have spent time there. He also published several books of works in Liegnitz after 1606, and so it is probable that he lived there for some time. However, he is not listed in any of the surviving city payrolls. He is presumed to have lived in Jauer from 1616, and probably died there in or after 1624, the date of his last publications. Elsbeth left a significant body of extant motets and songs. Elsbeth\\'s songs, of which there are about 100, are for three to five voices; some are in a homophonic style and others are set in a polyphonic chorale style. He never took up use of the basso continuo, despite its increasing popularity via Italy in the beginning of the 17th century. Of about 150 motets, most of the early works are in Latin and most of the later in German. His Evangelien collections are calendrical settings of the Gospels, which together cover the entire church year. The settings contain the text of the gospel reading for the day as well as a short introductory phrase which summarizes or sets the stage for the actual Biblical passage.'], ['Old Works', \"Like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, Old\\nWorks Golf Course has been reborn on the\\nsite of Anaconda's century old copper smelter.\\nDesigned by Jack Nicklaus, Old Works incorporates\\nhistoric relics including granite slabs from\\nthe old mill that line the banks of trout filled\\nWarm Springs Creek, protecting the 10th green.\\nLocated in the heart of southwestern Montana,\\nbetween Yellowstone and Glacier National Park,\\nOld Works has become one of the most unique and\\nmemorable golf experiences in the northwest.\\nEstablished in 1997.\\nIn 1883, an Irish immigrant named Marcus Daly, backed by J.B.

Rackley had been held and tortured at New Haven, Connecticut Panther headquarters for two days, under suspicion of being an informant for the FBI's COINTELPRO program. It was established at the trial that afterwards, Warren Kimbro, a resident of the house, McLucas, and national Panther field marshal George W. Sams, Jr. had driven Rackely to the marshes of Middlefield, Connecticut, where Kimbro and McLucas had each shot Rackley, on Sams' orders. Sams testified that national Panther leader Bobby Seale, who had been speaking at Yale University the day previous to the murder, had personally ordered the killing, but there was no corroborating evidence, and Seale was acquitted by a hung jury. According to Michael Koskoff, one of the lawyers for McLucas, McLucas was arrested a month after the murder in Salt Lake City, Utah, and brought back to New Haven for trial. He pled not guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit murder, but was found guilty and received a sentence of twelve to fifteen years, but served only a small part of that sentence. The case later became part of an urban legend that Hillary Clinton defended Bobby Seale and helped him get acquitted.

The fair was first held in 1107 or 1108 after King Henry I of the Kingdom of England granted Ralph de Luffa, Bishop of Chichester, the right to hold a fair for a period of eight days from a date of de Luffa\\'s choosing. The fair was originally chosen to coincide with the Feast of Saint Faith the Virgin on 6 October, a Gallo-Romano saint with a strong following in the area, but in 1207 a license was awarded for the fair to be held several days later, on the Vigil of the Feast of the Holy Trinity and the eight days thereafter. It is, however, unclear whether the date of the fair was actually changed, and according to records held in the library of Chichester Cathedral, as late as the 18th Century the Court of Piepowders that was held on the occasion of the fair took place between the Feast of Saint Faith and the Eve of Saint Edward the Confessor, on 12 October. The name \"Sloe Fair\" is believed to be a reference to a sloe tree that grew on the original site of the fair, in a field just outside Chichester\\'s North Gate. In its heyday, the fair attracted traders and visitors from across Southern England. Though the specific form of the event has changed over the centuries, the Sloe Fair continues to be held in the modern era. The Sloe Fair was not held during World War II and during the hostilities a caravan was placed at the site at which the fair is held, to prevent the right to hold a fair from lapsing. The modern Sloe Fair is organized by the Showmen\\'s Guild of Great Britain and the main attractions are mechanical fairground rides. In 2009, it was reported in the local press that the Showmens\\' Guild\\'s right to hold the Sloe Fair stood in the way of proposals to construct a multi-storey car park on the site of Northgate carpark, where the fair is held.'], ['Schmitt Heating Co', \"Our customers enjoy the safest, healthiest, most comfortable and economical indoor comfort system when installed by our professional Nate Certified Team.

He became known in the 1990s for his research on the use of genetic algorithms to evolve neural networks using three-dimensional cellular automata inside field programmable gate arrays. He claimed that this approach would enable the creation of what he terms \"artificial brains\" which would quickly surpass human levels of intelligence. He has more recently been noted for his belief that a major war between the supporters and opponents of intelligent machines, resulting in billions of deaths, is almost inevitable before the end of the 21st century.:234 He suggests AIs may simply eliminate the human race, and humans would be powerless to stop them because of technological singularity. This prediction has attracted debate and criticism from the AI research community, and some of its more notable members, such as Kevin Warwick, Bill Joy, Ken MacLeod, Ray Kurzweil, and Hans Moravec, have voiced their opinions on whether or not this future is likely.

In a normal internal combustion engine, because cylinder bore diameter, piston stroke length and combustion chamber volume are almost always constant, the compression ratio (CR) for a given engine is almost always constant. One exception is the experimental Saab Variable Compression (SVC) engine, designed for the Saab 9-5. This engine uses a technique that dynamically alters the volume of the combustion chamber, thus changing the compression ratio. To alter the combustion chamber volume, the SVC 'lowers' the cylinder head closer to the crankshaft. It does this by replacing the typical one-part engine block with a two-part block, with the crankshaft in the lower block and the cylinders in the upper portion. The two blocks are hinged together at one side. By pivoting the upper block around the hinge point, the volume of the combustion chamber can be modified. In practice, the SVC adjusts the upper block through a small range of motion, using a hydraulic actuator. This design was originally patented by Gregory J. Larsen of Lakeland, FL USA. The SVC project was shelved by General Motors, when it took over Saab Automobile, due to cost.[citation needed]\"], ['Maxine Wilson', 'Maxine Wilson is the former mayor of Coquitlam, British Columbia.

CMOS technology is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, static RAM, and other digital logic circuits. CMOS technology is also used for several analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensor), data converters, and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication. In 1963, while working for Fairchild Semiconductor, Frank Wanlass patented CMOS (US patent 3,356,858). CMOS is also sometimes referred to as complementary-symmetry metal–oxide–semiconductor (or COS-MOS).The words \"complementary-symmetry\" refer to the fact that the typical design style with CMOS uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) for logic functions. Two important characteristics of CMOS devices are high noise immunity and low static power consumption.Since one transistor of the pair is always off, the series combination draws significant power only momentarily during switching between on and off states. Consequently, CMOS devices do not produce as much waste heat as other forms of logic, for example transistor–transistor logic (TTL) or NMOS logic, which normally have some standing current even when not changing state. CMOS also allows a high density of logic functions on a chip. It was primarily for this reason that CMOS became the most used technology to be implemented in VLSI chips. The phrase \"metal–oxide–semiconductor\" is a reference to the physical structure of certain field-effect transistors, having a metal gate electrode placed on top of an oxide insulator, which in turn is on top of a semiconductor material. Aluminium was once used but now the material is polysilicon. Other metal gates have made a comeback with the advent of high-k dielectric materials in the CMOS process, as announced by IBM and Intel for the 45 nanometer node and beyond.'], ['Troy, New Hampshire', 'Troy is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States.

The film is set in the mind of a young girl named Riley Andersen (Kaitlyn Dias), where five personified emotions—Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)—try to lead her through life as her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) move the family from Minnesota to San Francisco and she has to adjust to her new life. Docter first began developing Inside Out in 2009 after noticing changes in his daughter's personality as she grew older. The film's producers consulted numerous psychologists, including Dacher Keltner from the University of California, Berkeley, who helped revise the story by emphasizing the neuropsychological findings that human emotions affect interpersonal relationships and can be significantly moderated by them.

Francis I was looking for allies in Central Europe to create a balance against the power of Habsburg Emperor Charles V. Queen Bona Sforza, the Italian wife of Sigismund, was instrumental in promoting the alliance, with the objective of recovering sovereignty of Milan. Sigismund himself was motivated by such an alliance because Charles V was getting closer to Russia, thus threatening Poland on two fronts. The negotiations were handled by Antonio Rincon in 1524, who was then followed by Jerome Laski. Through the agreement, the son of Francis, Henry, Duke of Orléans, was to marry a daughter of Sigismund I, and Sigismund's eldest son was to marry a daughter of Francis I. According to the same agreement, Sigismund was supposed to support Francis' efforts at reconquering Milan to which Sigismund had some right through his earlier marriage with Bona Sforza. The alliance was effectively signed in 1524. The agreement fell through, however, when Francis I was vanquished by Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525.

Sexual Behavior in the Human Female was based on personal interviews with approximately 6,000 women.

Comparisons are made of female and male sexual activities. Kinsey\\'s evidence suggested that women were less sexually active than men. The publications were immediately controversial among the general public. The findings caused shock and outrage, both because they challenged conventional beliefs about sexuality and because they discussed subjects that had previously been taboo.

He was born in Carmarthen, where he received his early education, then lived near Llanelli prior to moving to England. During the First World War he served in the Royal Army Corps. By profession, he was a mechanical engineer and civil servant, but his reputation rests on his achievements as an amateur astronomer, particularly as a selenographer. He was elected to the British Astronomical Association in 1918 and was Director of its Lunar Section from 1946 to 1956. He produced a 100\" map of the Moon, which included new names for a number of features. In 1948 he put forward a request to the IAU that twenty-two new names be adopted. However he was turned down on the premise that the features were small or near the limb and already had letter designations. In 1951 he published a 300\"-diameter map of the Moon, considered by some as the culmination of the art of selenography prior to the space age. However his maps were dense with detail, some of which was fictitious, making them less useful. He made additional requests to the IAU in 1952 and 1955, which were turned down. However the Goodacre and Mee crater names from a 1926 map he had produced did become part of the lunar nomenclature. He also published a number of books intended to popularize astronomy, including two works in collaboration with Sir Patrick Moore. The most notable was his work, The Moon, which included his map. The crater Wilkins on the Moon is named after him. For many years Wilkins took the astronomy evening class at Crayford Manor House where they continue to use a copy of his 300-inch map regularly in the observatory. Wilkins died on 23 January 1960, having only retired on 31 December 1959.'], ['Wannabees', \"Wannabees is a fun Indoor Theme Park featuring a child size city with fire and police stations, hospital, post office, restaurant, gym, TV studio.... where children can dress up, role play and make up their own adventures.\\nWe can organise unique Children Birthday Parties.\\nOur Primary School Excursions are fun and in line with the NSW Syllabus.\\nWe also do corporate events and fans and followers celebrations.\\nOnce a month, on last Friday of the month, we organise themed kids Disco nigths where parents get in for free and can bring their own wine and beer.\\nOn Saturday nights, every fortnight we organize a Family Dinner, where a guest Chef organises a restaurant quality dinner, just for our customers!!!!\\nAre you a company looking for a unique and long term opportunity to create awareness and build brand loyalty within your niche market?\\nBecause of the cluttered marketplace, brands need to be extremely strategic and selective about how they spend their marketing budgets.

The latter, usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. Smith is cited as the father of modern economics and is still among the most influential thinkers in the field of economics today. Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot, John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift. In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. The minor planet 12838 Adamsmith was named in his memory.'], ['George F.

They are credited with transforming Chile into Latin America's best performing economy and one of the world's best business climates.

Some (such as Nobel laureate Amartya Sen) have argued that these policies were deliberately intended to serve the interests of American corporations at the expense of Latin American populations.

The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.

The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners.

(21 February 1801 – 11 August 1890), also referred to as Cardinal Newman, John Henry Cardinal Newman, and Blessed John Henry Newman, was an important figure in the religious history of England in the 19th century. He was known nationally by the mid-1830s. Originally an evangelical Oxford University academic and priest in the Church of England, Newman then became drawn to the high-church tradition of Anglicanism. He became known as a leader of, and an able polemicist for, the Oxford Movement, an influential and controversial grouping of Anglicans who wished to return to the Church of England many Catholic beliefs and liturgical rituals from before the English Reformation. In this the movement had some success. However, in 1845 Newman, joined by some but not all of his followers, left the Church of England and his teaching post at Oxford University and was received into the Catholic Church. He was quickly ordained as a priest and continued as an influential religious leader, based in Birmingham. In 1879, he was created a cardinal by Pope Leo XIII in recognition of his services to the cause of the Catholic Church in England. He was instrumental in the founding of the Catholic University of Ireland, which evolved into University College, Dublin, today the largest university in Ireland. Newman\\'s beatification was officially proclaimed by Pope Benedict XVI on 19 September 2010 during his visit to the United Kingdom. His canonisation is dependent on the documentation of additional miracles attributed to his intercession. Newman was also a literary figure of note: his major writings including the Tracts for the Times (1833–1841), his autobiography Apologia Pro Vita Sua (1865–66), the Grammar of Assent (1870), and the poem The Dream of Gerontius (1865), which was set to music in 1900 by Edward Elgar.

In 1993, he entered the University of Manitoba where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts-Honors degree. He is the recipient of two University of Manitoba Gold Medals, a Shanski Fine Arts Bursary, two Heins Jordan Awards and an undergraduate scholarship for the highest standing in the Faculty of Fine Arts.\\nBetween 1980 and 1992, El Salvador was torn apart by a civil war fought between the Salvadorian military dictatorship and a unified leftist opposition guerrilla movement known as the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). The twelve-year struggle claimed 75,000 lives, left 8,000 more missing and a million each homeless and exiled. Not surprisingly, some of the most compelling images in Lopezdabdoub's body of work deal with war and its toll. Still, the artist is not especially concerned with the concrete and tangible horror of bullets and guns but rather with the effect that, in a metaphysical sense, particular events have in people's psyche. His work is a universal and humanistic form of art that evaluates events according to the consequences they have for the human experience. His paintings are critical visual commentaries on pressing economical, political, cultural and social issues. The voices of the people who inhabit his canvases are denunciatory pointing to the terror and other feelings or emotions associated with existing in dysfunctional and destructive environments.\\nJuan's practice spans a diversity of media, including painting, sculpture, photography, digital media and most recently video. Because the subject matter of his work is as important as the form, Juan likes to describe himself as a visual storyteller.\"], ['Maciej Zieliński', \"Maciej Zieliński - born in Warsaw on 29 March 1971, Polish composer.

He was a successful business man, which eminently helped him achieve great charitable work, to which he chiefly devoted his attention. He established the Jewish Board of Guardians in London in 1859. Ephraim Alex imparted his zeal and public spirit to the community, which rapidly developed and perfected the organisation. A suggestion had indeed been made as early as 1802 by Joshua Van Oven to replace the loose and imperfect arrangement between the three German synagogues by a definite Board of Guardians for the Jewish poor. This suggestion was, however, lost sight of until 1858, when Alex was overseer of the Great Synagogue. He became impressed that the inadequate system for outdoor charity begun to prevail. He ventilated the subject energetically before his own council and vestry as well as on various public occasions. In February, 1859, he issued a circular proposing \"a scheme for a Board of Guardians for the relief of the necessitous foreign poor.\" This scheme exhibited a great insight into the needs of the poor, as well as a comprehensive idea of the machinery necessary to relieve them. The keynote of the circular and scheme was organization, and the subsequent development of the board had been strictly on the lines of Alex\\'s original conception. He was not a man of commanding intellect, but he possessed a genial and tactful disposition which attracted young men to undertake.

The charter dates to some point between the years 1140 and 1153, although it can probably be pinned down to the year 1150. There certainly was a bishopric of Brechin in 1150, as there exists another charter of King David's, this time granted to the bishop (unnamed) and Céli Dé of Brechin. It is known that Samson was still bishop in the reign of King Máel Coluim IV (1153–1165), appearing as a witness as late as 1165 in a charter of Richard, Bishop of St. Andrews. Samson was a native cleric of Brechin. He was very likely the son of Léot, an earlier Abbot of Brechin, and father of Domnall, a later Abbot of Brechin.

Skinner', 'Burrhus Frederic Skinner (March 20, 1904 – August 18, 1990), commonly known as B. F. Skinner, was an American psychologist, behaviorist, author, inventor, and social philosopher. He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1974. Skinner considered free will an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance that the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, however, the actions that led to it will become more probable. Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement. Skinner called the use of reinforcement to strengthen behavior operant conditioning, and he considered the rate of response to be the most effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning he invented the operant conditioning chamber, also known as the Skinner Box, and to measure rate he invented the cumulative recorder. Using these tools he and C. B. Ferster produced his most influential experimental work, which appeared in the book Schedules of Reinforcement. Skinner developed a philosophy of science that he called radical behaviorism, and founded a school of experimental research psychology—the experimental analysis of behavior. He imagined the application of his ideas to the design of a human community in his utopian novel Walden Two, and his analysis of human behavior culminated in his work Verbal Behavior. Skinner was a prolific author who published 21 books and 180 articles. Contemporary academia considers Skinner a pioneer of modern behaviorism along with John B. Watson and Ivan Pavlov. A June 2002 survey listed Skinner as the most influential psychologist of the 20th century.'], ['Innovative Realty', \"Welcome to Innovative Realty.\\nWe do things a little differently than others.

Robert married Edith Forne, daughter of Lord Greystoke, who had been King Henry I of England's concubine, in 1120. The marriage also meant Robert became Lord of the Manor of Cleydon. In 1129, he was persuaded by his wife to build the Church of St Mary, in the Isle of Osney, near Oxford Castle, for the use of Augustine Monks - this was to become Osney Abbey. By 1141 Robert had inherited his father's position of Lord of Oxford Castle and Baron Hocknorton and it was he that declared his support for Empress Matilda against King Stephen, giving her protection in Oxford between 1141 and the winter of 1142. It is because of this action that Stephen came to Oxford and besieged the castle for three months, burning the city down in the process. Matilda supposedly escaped by dressing in white as a form of camouflage against the snow-covered ground, and fleeing across the frozen Castle Mill Stream. It is likely that Robert died shortly after this as governorship of the castle changed hands, though whether his death was at the hands of the King is not known.

The term Chicano is sometimes used interchangeably with Mexican[-]American. Both names are chosen identities within the Mexican-American community in the United States. However, these terms have a wide range of meanings in various parts of the Southwest. The term became widely used during the Chicano Movement, mainly among Mexican Americans within the city of Chicago[citation needed] who wanted to express an identity, of cultural, ethnic and community pride, similarly to the Chicago Polonia. The term \"Chicano\" had negative connotations before the Chicano Movement, and still is viewed negatively by more conservative members of this community, but it over time gained more acceptance as an identity of pride within the Mexican-American community in the United States. Still, many American-born Mexicans view the term to be distracting, as it often represents a refusal to identify with either Mexican or American identities, while Mexicans from Mexico usually aren\\'t familiar with or do not identify with the term.[citation needed] The pro-indigenous/Mestizo nature of Chicano nationalism is cemented in the nature of Mexican national identity, in which the culture is heavily syncretic between indigenous and Spanish cultures, and where 60% of the population is Mestizo, and another 30% are indigenous, with the remaining 10% being of European heritage and others racial/ethnic groups.

He was, alongside Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov, one of the seven members of the first Politburo, founded in 1917 in order to manage the Bolshevik Revolution. During the early days of the RSFSR and the Soviet Union, he served first as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and later as the founder and commander of the Red Army with the title of People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs. He was a major figure in the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War (1918–1923). After leading a failed struggle of the Left Opposition against the policies and rise of Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and against the increasing role of bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, Trotsky was removed from power (October 1927), expelled from the Communist Party (November 1927), and finally exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). As the head of the Fourth International, Trotsky continued in exile to oppose the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union. On Stalin's orders, he was assassinated in Mexico in August 1940 by Ramón Mercader, a Spanish-born Soviet agent. Trotsky's ideas formed the basis of Trotskyism, a major school of Marxist thought that opposes the theories of Stalinism. He was one of the few Soviet political figures who were not rehabilitated by the government under Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s. In the late 1980s, his books were released for publication in the Soviet Union.\"], ['Reuben Jones', 'Reuben (Ben) Jones (born 19 October 1932 in Newport, Shropshire, England; died 3 January 1990 in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire) was an Olympic equestrian rider who competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.'], ['Nectan of Hartland', 'Saint Nectan, sometimes styled Saint Nectan of Hartland, was a 5th-century holy man who lived in Stoke, Hartland, in the English county of Devon, where the prominent Church of Saint Nectan, Hartland is dedicated to him.'], ['Knutson Jewelers', \"- We're custom jewelers, second to none.

The regime would only end in 1974, with the Carnation Revolution, that implemented broad democratic changes in the country. Since then, four types of elections are held with different periodicity. The head of state, the President of the Republic, is elected for a five-year term, the Parliament is elected for a four-year term, like the municipal administrations, that since 1985, are also elected for a four-year term. Azores and Madeira elect a regional parliament each four years. Along with these, European elections are also held with a periodicity of five years since the country joined the European Union in 1986. Since the revolution, the Party participated in every election, from the late 1970s until 1987, it ran in coalition with the Portuguese Democratic Movement in the United People Alliance (APU). In 1987, the APU was disbanded and since then, the Party participated in coalition with the Ecologist Party \"The Greens\" inside the Unitarian Democratic Coalition (CDU). The peak of the Party\\'s electoral influence was from the Carnation Revolution until the early 1980s, since then, and mainly after the fall of the Socialist bloc in eastern Europe, the Party\\'s electoral success was reduced, however, it still keeps a presence in the Parliament and still holds the presidency of 34 municipalities and several parishes.'], ['Gustave Niebaum', \"Gustave Ferdinand Niebaum (originally Gustaf Ferdinand Nybom) (b. 1842 in Oulu, Finland - 1908) acquired his maritime schooling in Helsinki, Finland.

The confrontation was unrelated to the running of the race. In addition, 1976 would be the final Indy 500 for longtime radio anchor Sid Collins. After a surgery to repair a disk in his neck, Collins was still suffering muscular and neurological ailments, which made his work at the 1976 race physically difficult. He was later diagnosed with ALS, and committed suicide on May 3, 1977. Rutherford's victory would be the final win at Indy for the venerable Offenhauser engine. It was the beginning of the end of an era which had seen 27 Indy 500 victories for the Offy powerplant.

The inflationary epoch lasted from 10−36 seconds after the Big Bang to sometime between 10−33 and 10−32 seconds. Following the inflationary period, the Universe continues to expand, but at a less rapid rate. Inflation theory was developed in the early 1980s. It explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. Quantum fluctuations in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the Universe (see galaxy formation and evolution and structure formation). Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the Universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the Universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed. While the detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is not known, the basic picture makes a number of predictions that have been confirmed by observation. The hypothetical field thought to be responsible for inflation is called the inflaton. In 2002, three of the original architects of the theory were recognized for their major contributions; physicists Alan Guth of M.I.T., Andrei Linde of Stanford and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton shared the prestigious Dirac Prize \"for development of the concept of inflation in cosmology\".'], ['Turner Broadcasting System', \"Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. is an American media conglomerate that is a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia, and manages the collection of cable television networks and properties initiated or acquired by Ted Turner.

It is built on a rocky outcrop, overlooking the village of Taillebourg and the valley of the Charente River, in the Charente-Maritime department of France. It commanded a very strategic position and was therefore the focus of much conflict throughout the medieval era. It featured in several episodes of the Hundred Years' War and the Saintonge War before that. The previous castle on the site was shelter for Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine on the day after their wedding, in July 1137. Richard Coeur de Lion destroyed this castle in 1179. Geoffrey III of Rancon, master of the house, died in this action. In 1173, Richard had fought against his father in alliance with his brothers and the King of France, Louis. This uprising had failed, and as punishment, Richard was sent to bring the rebellious lords to heel. This conflict lasted five years, ending in the victory of Richard and his destruction of the supposedly impregnable fortress of Taillebourg. This castle was inaccessible on three sides, protected by mountains, and the fourth side was heavily fortified. Richard knew that the overthrow of Taillebourg would lead to the immediate surrender of the barons, and captured the stronghold in his first great military victory. The current castle was the base for Louis IX of France (Saint Louis), as a guest of Geoffrey IV of Rancon, before the Battle of Taillebourg in 1242. The Château de Taillebourg has today been converted to a public garden, where one can view the machicolations, the 18th-century battlements and the underground rooms of the old castle. The site's geographical position affords a viewpoint of the valley of the Charente.\"], ['Your Malta Guide', 'Hi, my name’s Charmaine… Your Malta Guide! ', 'Thank you for visiting my site.

Quaatz was a member of the Reichstag, first being elected in 1920 for the German People's Party (DVP) before switching to the German National People's Party (DNVP) and retaining his seat until the establishment of the Nazi regime. He had been a member of the Nationalliberale Vereinigung, a landowners group that was affiliated to the DVP, and which also included the likes of Johann Becker, Moritz Klönne, Albert Vögler and Alfred Gildemeister, but then clashed with the leadership and switched to the DNVP in early 1924. As a result Quaatz ran on the DNVP ticket for the May 1924 election and from then on. As a DNVP member Quaatz was personally close to party leader Alfred Hugenberg. The industrialist frequently confided in his friend, a fact demonstrated when Quaatz's diaries were published in 1989. Despite his mother being Jewish Quaatz endorsed anti-Semitic policies during his time as a DNVP politician and even encouraged Hugenburg to work closely with Adolf Hitler as he feared both socialism and the political Catholicism of the Centre Party. Away from politics he was an industrialist and financier and in early 1933 he was appointed to the board of the Dresdner Bank. He was removed from this position in February 1936 as the Nazi laws barred Mischling from such positions.

The concept is also used in biology. In a feedback loop, the output of a device, process or plant is sampled and applied to alter the input, to better control the output. The loop gain, along with the related concept of loop phase shift, determines the behavior of the device, and particularly whether the output is stable, or unstable, which can result in oscillation. The importance of loop gain as a parameter for characterizing electronic feedback amplifiers was first recognized by Heinrich Barkhausen in 1921,was developed further by Hendrik Wade Bode and Harry Nyquist at Bell Labs in the 1930s. A block diagram of an electronic amplifier with negative feedback is shown at right. The input signal is applied to the amplifier with open-loop gain A and amplified. The output of the amplifier is applied to a feedback network with gain β, and subtracted from the input to the amplifier. The loop gain is calculated by imagining the feedback loop is broken at some point, and calculating the net gain if a signal is applied. In the diagram shown, the loop gain is the product of the gains of the amplifier and the feedback network, −Aβ. The minus sign is because the feedback signal is subtracted from the input. In amplifiers, the loop gain is the difference between the open-loop gain curve and the closed-loop gain curve (actually, the 1/β curve) on a dB scale. The gains A and β, and therefore the loop gain, generally vary with the frequency of the input signal, and so are usually expressed as functions of the angular frequency ω in radians per second.'], ['Chris Parish', 'I’m passionate about the subject of Britain, having spent years studying the national culture, identity and values of the country.

Hill was originally sentenced to life imprisonment for shooting his girlfriend, Myra Wright, in 1985. He was subsequently sentenced to death for killing his cellmate, Joseph Handspike. In 1990 Hill killed Handspike in their cell by bludgeoning him to death with a wooden board studded with nails. His execution by lethal injection, scheduled for July 15, 2013, was postponed due to a legal challenge against Georgia's Lethal Injections Secrecy Act. This law, passed in March 2013, makes the identities of companies and individuals who make and supply lethal injection drugs, and the identities of the doctors hired by the state to oversee executions, a “state secret” that must be shielded from disclosure to the public, the media, and even the judiciary. Hill's lawyers successfully argued that this would prevent Hill from knowing whether the execution would be carried out by competent personnel using properly formulated drugs. The secrecy regime was ultimately upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court. There was also controversy as to whether or not Hill qualified as being mentally disabled, a designation that would have precluded him from being executed. On this basis of his mental capabilities the European Union had appealed several times to the Georgia Chairman of the Board of Pardons and Paroles and Georgia Governor Nathan Deal to prevent Hill from being executed.

His first house, built in the valley where the Indians lived, has not survived; this house was built in the white community on the hill above the town following his marriage in 1739. It remained in the Sergeant family until the 1870s, and survived Gilded Age developments of the late 19th century. In the 1920s the house was purchased by Mabel Choate, owner of the nearby Naumkeag estate, and moved down into the valley. She and landscape designer Fletcher Steele restored the building, furnished it with 18th century pieces, and designed gardens to Steele's vision of what a colonial landscape might have been. Choate opened the house as a museum in 1930, and donated it (and eventually Naumkeag as well) to the Trustees of Reservations, who operate both properties as museums.\"], ['Anne-Marie L Bowen PA', \"Bankruptcy Law\\nForeclosure Defense\\nCreditor Negotiations\\nProbate Law\\nEstate Planning\\nEstablished in 1994.\\nAnne-Marie L.

Originally created by Edward E. Simbalist and Wilf K. Backhaus in 1977, Chivalry & Sorcery (C&S) was an early competitor to Dungeons & Dragons. Historically, the two designers of the game were dissatisfied with the lack of realism in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and created the first gaming system derived from it, which they named Chevalier. They intended to present it to Gary Gygax at Gen Con in 1977, but changed their minds once at the Con, where they met Scott Bizar who wrote out a letter of intent. After some final changes to get rid of the last remnants of D&D (e.g. the game contained a table of \"Saving-throws\" similar to D&D), Simbalist and Backhaus published the first edition of their game - now renamed Chivalry & Sorcery - shortly after the release of the first edition of Advanced D&D. According to Michael Tresca, Chivalry & Sorcery \"embraced a realistic approach to medieval France in the 12th century, complete with feudalism and the Catholic Church. Chivalry & Sorcery was most noteworthy for creating the term \"game master.\" It was one of the first games to place the setting at utmost importance over the mechanics of the game.\" More focused on medieval chivalry than fantasy, Chivalry & Sorcery (C&S) had from its first version a sophisticated and complex set of rules. The game has been published four times to improve its presentation and to modernize its game mechanics. C&S was the first to introduce new concepts like levels for monsters.[citation needed] Players could adventure in a variety of locations instead of being confined to a dark underground dungeon.

Born in Brussels as the second (but eldest surviving) son of Leopold I and Louise of Orléans, he succeeded his father to the throne on 17 December 1865, reigning for exactly 44 years until his death. This was the longest reign of any Belgian monarch. Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used explorer Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. From the beginning, however, Leopold essentially ignored these conditions. He ran the Congo using the mercenary Force Publique for his personal enrichment. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium. Leopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the natives to harvest and process rubber. Under his regime millions of Congolese people died; modern estimates range from 1 to 15 million, with a consensus growing around 10 million. Human rights abuses under his regime contributed significantly to these deaths. Reports of deaths and abuse led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and Leopold was ultimately forced by the Belgian government to relinquish control of the colony to the civil administration in 1908.'], ['Paul Kirchhoff', \"Paul Kirchhoff (17 August 1900, Halle, Province of Westphalia – 9 December 1972) was a German-Mexican anthropologist, most noted for his seminal work in defining and elaborating the culture area of Mesoamerica, a term he coined.

All the books are written in first-person with the first three having Claudine herself as the narrator. The last in the series, Claudine s\\'en va, introduces a new narrator, Annie. The novels were written in the late 19th century in collaboration with Colette\\'s first husband, the writer Henry Gauthier-Villars, better known by his nom-de-plume \"Willy\". There has been much speculation over the degree of involvement of both Colette and Willy in the writing of the Claudine novels, particularly as Willy was known for often using ghostwriters. Consequently although the novels were originally attributed to Willy only and published under his name alone, they were later published under both names. After the death of Willy, Colette went to court to challenge her former husband\\'s involvement in any of the writing, and subsequently had his name removed from the books. This decision however was overturned after her death, as Willy\\'s son from a prior relationship, Jacques Gauthier-Villars, successfully sued to have his father\\'s name restored.
