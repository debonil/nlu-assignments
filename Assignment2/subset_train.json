Such widespread travels presented the opportunity for first-hand interaction with such exotic species as aardwolves, echidnas, and megamouth sharks (these and other creatures later appeared in his syndicated newspaper column, \"Animal Journal\"). He has since returned to his native Southwest, where he lives in an adobe home surrounded by native desert vegetation and wildlife.

Yet, in Spanish, there also exists the adjective embarazoso, meaning the same as \"embarrassing\" in its denotation of something that causes a sensation of unease, but not of shame.

{"fold": 4, "source": "DBpedia Abstract", "documentId": "7791", "documentText": "Hachmei Provence\n\nThe term Hachmei Provence refers to the Jewish rabbis of Provence, a province in southern France, which was a great Torah center in the times of the Tosafists. The phrase literally means the wise of Provence. In matters of Halacha, as well as in their traditions and custom, the Proven\u00e7al rabbis occupy an intermediate position between the Sephardic tradition of the neighboring Spanish scholars, and the Old French (similar to the Ashkenazic) tradition represented by the Tosafists. The term \"Provence\" in Jewish tradition is not limited to today's administrative region of Provence but refers to the whole of Occitania. This includes Narbonne (which is sometimes informally, though incorrectly, transliterated as \"Narvona\" as a result of the back-and-forth transliteration between Hebrew and French), Lunel (which is informally transliterated as \"Lunil\"), and the city of Montpellier, not far (7 km) from the mediterranean coast.

During the following year, he began clinical work under the psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and did laboratory work with Franz Nissl and Alois Alzheimer in Munich. In 1911, by way of an invitation from Wilhelm Weygandt, he relocated to Hamburg, where he worked with Theodor Kaes and eventually became head of the laboratory of anatomical pathology at the psychiatric State Hospital Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as prosector. During World War I he served as an army physician in Belgium, and afterwards returned to Hamburg. In 1919 he obtained his habilitation for neurology and in 1924 became a professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made significant contributions to knowledge on concussion and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of neuropathology. Jakob was the author of five monographs and nearly 80 scientific papers. His neuropathological research contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Friedreich's ataxia. He first recognised and described Alper's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (named along with Munich neuropathologist Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt). He gained experience in neurosyphilis, having a 200-bed ward devoted entirely to that disorder.

He became interested in the Reform movement of William Lyon Mackenzie and took part in the Upper Canada Rebellion. Gould was captured and sentenced to be exiled to Van Diemen's Land but his sentence was reduced to 9 months in prison. He was pardoned as part of a general amnesty in 1838. After his release, his farm prospered; he also owned mills and factories and operated the Whitby, Lake Scugog, Simcoe and Huron Road. He also promoted the development of railway links in the region. Gould served on the district council from 1842 to 1854 and became the first reeve of Uxbridge Township and the first warden for Ontario County. He was elected to the Legislative Council for the North Riding of Ontario in 1854 and 1857; he was defeated in 1861. While in office, he helped pass measures to abolish seigneurial tenure and secularize the clergy reserves. After he left politics, he helped other members in his community by supporting the building of churches and primary schools. Having received very little schooling himself, he did not believe in higher education. He died in Uxbridge in 1886.

The name Alan is an Iranian dialectical form of Aryan, a common self-designation of the Indo-Iranians. Possibly related to the Massagetae, the Alans have been connected by modern historians with the Central Asian Yancai and Aorsi of Chinese and Roman sources respectively. Having migrated westwards and become dominant among the Sarmatians on the Pontic Steppe, they are mentioned by Persian and Roman sources in the 1st century AD. At the time they had settled the region north of the Black Sea, and frequently raided the Parthian Empire and the Caucasian provinces of the Roman Empire. In 215-250 AD their power on the Pontic Steppe was broken by the Goths. Upon the Hunnic defeat of the Goths on the Pontic Steppe around 375 AD, many of the Alans migrated westwards along with various Germanic tribes. They crossed the Rhine in 406 AD along with the Vandals and Suebi, settling in Orl\u00e9ans and Valence. Around 409 AD they joined the Vandals and Suebi in the crossing of the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula, settling in Lusitania and Carthaginiensis. The Iberian Alans were soundly defeated by the Visigoths 418 AD, and subsequently surrendered their authority to the Hasdingi Vandals. In 428 AD, the Vandals and Alans crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into North Africa, where they founded a powerful kingdom which lasted until its conquest by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century AD. The Alans who remained under Hunnic rule founded a powerful kingdom in the North Caucasus in the Middle Ages, which ended with the Mongol invasions in the 13th century AD. These Alans are said to be the ancestors of the modern Ossetians.

Lyrical and almost epigrammatic in form, the poems wistfully evoke the dooms and disappointments of youth in the English countryside . Their beauty, simplicity and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste, and to many early 20th-century English composers (beginning with Arthur Somervell) both before and after the First World War. Through their song-settings, the poems became closely associated with that era, and with Shropshire itself. Housman was one of the foremost classicists of his age and has been ranked as one of the greatest scholars who ever lived.

Koss was a student of R. K. Webb. He began his academic career at the University of Delaware, and became an assistant professor at Barnard College, New York City in 1966, and then a full professor in 1971. He was appointed a professor of history at Columbia University in 1978, where he had completed his bachelor and masters degrees, as well as his doctorate; the doctoral thesis was turned into his first book John Morley at the India Office, 1905\u20131910 published in 1969, the same year as his biography of R. B. Haldane. He was also a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He served on the editorial board of The Journal of Modern History and held office with the North American Conference on British Studies. He died on 25 October 1984 as a result of complications following heart surgery. The historian F. M. Leventhal noted that as Koss matured there was \"an increasingly irreverent and ironic tone in [his] scholarship, a willingness to criticize as well as to condone\". His death was mourned in several academic books published soon after, together with that of Alan J. Lee, who had also written on the history of newspapers in Britain and who had also died at a relatively young age. Koss is best remembered for a two-volume work The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain (1981, 1984), respectively covering the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Neal Ascherson, reviewing the second volume in 1985, wrote: \"Koss was the archive-cruncher of his age. But he had another gift, which was to make the imparting of densely-packed information stylish, readable, often mockingly witty.\" A tribute volume appeared in 1987: The Political Culture of Modern Britain: Studies in Memory of Stephen Koss, edited by J.

There, she failed to advance into the semifinals in any of her individual events, finishing fortieth in the 100 m freestyle (58.77), and forty-first in the 50 m freestyle (26.88). She also placed seventeenth, as a member of the South Korean team, in the 4 \u00d7 100 m medley relay (4:16.93). After an eight-year absence, Chang competed only in two events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She achieved FINA B-standards of 25.78 (50 m freestyle) and 56.50 (100 m freestyle) from the Dong-A Swimming Tournament in Ulsan. In the 100 m freestyle, Chang challenged seven other swimmers in heat three, including 18-year-old Arianna Vanderpool-Wallace of the Bahamas. She posted a lifetime best of 55.96 to earn a fourth spot and thirty-second overall by 0.34 of a second behind Austria's Birgit Koschischek. In the 50 m freestyle, Chang placed thirty-first on the morning's preliminaries. Swimming in heat nine, she raced to fifth place by a hundredth of a second (0.01) behind Canada's Victoria Poon in 25.59.", "passages": [{"passageId": "22902:15:144", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 15, "passageEnd": 144, "passageText": "Chang Hee-jin (Korean: \uc7a5\ud76c\uc9c4; born September 5, 1986) is a South Korean former swimmer, who specialized in sprint freestyle events.", "facts": [{"factId": "22902:101:104:48:65:15", "propertyId": "15", "humanReadable": "<who> <DATE_OF_BIRTH> <September 5, 1986>", "annotatedPassage": "Chang Hee-jin (Korean: \uc7a5\ud76c\uc9c4; born <September 5, 1986>) is a South Korean former swimmer, <who> specialized in sprint freestyle events.", "subjectStart": 101, "subjectEnd": 104, "subjectText": "who", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 48, "objectEnd": 65, "objectText": "September 5, 1986", "objectUri": ""}, {"factId": "22902:38:41:48:65:15", "propertyId": "15", "humanReadable": "<\uc7a5\ud76c\uc9c4> <DATE_OF_BIRTH> <September 5, 1986>", "annotatedPassage": "Chang Hee-jin (Korean: <\uc7a5\ud76c\uc9c4>; born <September 5, 1986>) is a South Korean former swimmer, who specialized in sprint freestyle events.", "subjectStart": 38, "subjectEnd": 41, "subjectText": "\uc7a5\ud76c\uc9c4", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 48, "objectEnd": 65, "objectText": "September 5, 1986", "objectUri": ""}, {"factId": "22902:15:28:48:65:15", "propertyId": "15", "humanReadable": "<Chang Hee-jin> <DATE_OF_BIRTH> <September 5, 1986>", "annotatedPassage": "<Chang Hee-jin> (Korean: \uc7a5\ud76c\uc9c4; born <September 5, 1986>) is a South Korean former swimmer, who specialized in sprint freestyle events.", "subjectStart": 15, "subjectEnd": 28, "subjectText": "Chang Hee-jin", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 48, "objectEnd": 65, "objectText": "September 5, 1986", "objectUri": ""}]}]}

The Winning Walk proclaims the proven truth of God\u2019s Word to give men and women the world over a winning way to live life.\nAbout Dr. Ed Young\nDr. H. Edwin Young was born in Laurel, Mississippi. He accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior at the age of 12 through the leading of his pastor's wife, Mrs. Gates.\nFollowing graduation from high school in Laurel, Dr. Young entered the University of Alabama as an engineering major. Mid-way through his freshman year, challenged by an atheist in his dorm who questioned his belief in God, he began to seek God's purpose for his life. Six months later, he surrendered to the call to preach the Gospel, and enrolled at Mississippi College to continue his education.\nOn June 28, 1959, he married Jo Beth Landrum. Dr. Young's preparation for the ministry continued at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina. His first pastorate was in North Carolina, and he pastored in North and South Carolina until 1978 when he moved to Houston, Texas. He became the pastor at Second Baptist Church where he continues to pastor today. The congregation has grown from 2,000 members in 1978 to over 6 campuses and we have reached over 70 thousand members.\nDr. Young was elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention in June of 1992 and again in June, 1993. He is the author of many books including, Total Heart Health, The 10 Commandments of Parenting, and The 10 Commandments of Marriage.

{"fold": 1, "source": "DBpedia Abstract", "documentId": "7965", "documentText": "Differential geometry of surfaces\n\nIn mathematics, the differential geometry of surfaces deals with the differential geometry of smooth surfaces with various additional structures, most often, a Riemannian metric.Surfaces have been extensively studied from various perspectives: extrinsically, relating to their embedding in Euclidean space and intrinsically, reflecting their properties determined solely by the distance within the surface as measured along curves on the surface. One of the fundamental concepts investigated is the Gaussian curvature, first studied in depth by Carl Friedrich Gauss (), who showed that curvature was an intrinsic property of a surface, independent of its isometric embedding in Euclidean space. Surfaces naturally arise as graphs of functions of a pair of variables, and sometimes appear in parametric form or as loci associated to space curves. An important role in their study has been played by Lie groups (in the spirit of the Erlangen program), namely the symmetry groups of the Euclidean plane, the sphere and the hyperbolic plane. These Lie groups can be used to describe surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature; they also provide an essential ingredient in the modern approach to intrinsic differential geometry through connections. On the other hand extrinsic properties relying on an embedding of a surface in Euclidean space have also been extensively studied. This is well illustrated by the non-linear Euler\u2013Lagrange equations in the calculus of variations: although Euler developed the one variable equations to understand geodesics, defined independently of an embedding, one of Lagrange's main applications of the two variable equations was to minimal surfaces, a concept that can only be defined in terms of an embedding.", "passages": [{"passageId": "7965:482:729", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "9", "propertyName": "EDUCATED_AT", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the institution where she/he studied."}], "passageStart": 482, "passageEnd": 729, "passageText": "One of the fundamental concepts investigated is the Gaussian curvature, first studied in depth by Carl Friedrich Gauss (), who showed that curvature was an intrinsic property of a surface, independent of its isometric embedding in Euclidean space.", "facts": []}]}

In further studies, he linked histone phosphorylation events to mitosis and mitogen action, established a synergy between histone phosphorylation and acetylation events and elaborated the \u2018histone code hypothesis\u2019 (and extensions thereof), one of the most highly cited theories governing epigenetics.

He was first hired by the 49ers in 2005 as their Western Region Scout, and three years later was promoted to Director of Player Personnel, a position largely responsible for overseeing the team's college scouting operations. Baalke was chosen to lead the 49ers in the 2010 NFL Draft, in place of McCloughan, and a month later was given the title of Vice President of Player Personnel. His official promotion to General Manager came shortly after the firing of Mike Singletary as head coach of the 49ers, in anticipation of needing an official GM to lure Jim Harbaugh away from Stanford for the vacant coaching position. Prior to joining the 49ers, Trent Baalke's NFL career included a stint as a scout for the New York Jets from 1998 to 2000, and four years with the Washington Redskins, first as a National Scout and then as College Scouting Coordinator. In January 2012, Baalke was named PFWA Executive of the Year for the 2011 season, after being credited for transforming a 6-10 team into a 13-3 team in his first season as General Manager. The next month he received a contract extension through 2016. Following a home game for the 49ers on Thanksgiving Day, 2014, in which the division-rival Seattle Seahawks defeated the 49ers 19-3, Baalke's daughter Cass stirred up a minor scandal when she suggested in a tweet that Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman should be dismissed from the team. After a 2014 season filled with reports that Baalke and then-49ers coach Jim Harbaugh had been clashing, the 49ers parted ways with Harbaugh and promoted defensive line coach Jim Tomsula to the head coaching position.

He was an editor at Rolling Stone and Oui magazine, and is the former editor-in-chief of Country Music magazine and a nationally syndicated country music columnist. McCabe wrote an article in the 28 February 1972 issue of New York magazine in which he alleged financial impropriety on the part of Allen Klein, manager of the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation, with regard to the dispersal of funds raised through US sales of George Harrison's The Concert for Bangladesh live album. The funds were intended for distribution to Bangladeshi refugees via UNICEF yet, according to McCabe, Klein's ABKCO company had withheld an amount of $1.14 per album. Klein responded with a $150 million libel suit, which he later withdrew. Later in 1972, McCabe's book Apple to the Core: The Unmaking of the Beatles, with co-writer Robert D. Schonfeld, was published by Pocket Books. The book focuses on the business problems that led to the group's break-up and again presented Klein in an unfavourable light.

Radama encouraged these London Missionary Society envoys to establish schools to teach tradecraft and literacy to nobles and potential military and civil service recruits; they also introduced Christianity and taught literacy using the translated Bible. A wide range of political and social reforms were enacted under his rule, including an end to the international slave trade, which had historically been a key source of wealth and armaments for the Merina monarchy. Through aggressive military campaigns he successfully united two-thirds of the island under his rule. Abuse of alcohol weakened his health and he died prematurely at age 32.

His exploits in the ODIs and T20Is impressed Chennai and they signed him during the 2013 auction for his base price of USD 20,000. The following year, he was thrown into the auction pool, where Hyderabad purchased him for USD 125,000.\nHolder, whose USP is to hit the deck hard and extract extra bounce, then became a regular feature in the West Indian ODI attack. Holder made his Test debut against New Zealand in the third Test of the home series. Though he only managed to pick up two wickets, he contributed with the bat by scoring a fifty in a losing cause. However, he remained on the sidelines for the subsequent two-match series against Bangladesh.\nWhen the players backed out of the India tour, citing trouble with payment issues, the board axed Dwayne Bravo from the skipper's role and handed it to Holder. His first real assignment came in the away series against South Africa, where he came under the scanner for allowing the hosts to put up 439 in the second game at Wanderers. Nonetheless, West Indies chief selector Clive Lloyd, feels that Holder is the best man to lead the Caribbean side in the 2015 World Cup.\nBy Cricbuzz Staff", "passages": [{"passageId": "19706:14:158", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "10", "propertyName": "NATIONALITY", "propertyDescription": "Describes he country of a person's citizenship or country in which the person is deemed a national."}], "passageStart": 14, "passageEnd": 158, "passageText": "Tall and lanky at 6\u20197\u201d, Jason Holder is a right-arm medium-fast bowler hailing from Barbados, who won the prestigious Lord Gavron Award in 2009.", "facts": []}]}

The hall seats up to 50 people and was designed upon commission for the Nixon family, local arts patrons who wanted a live-in studio for their daughter Milda's piano teacher, Mrs. Alma Kennedy. The room is paneled in unfinished clear-heart redwood, which contributes to an unusually rich and warm, yet bright and clear acoustic quality. There are two grand pianos in the space: a Yamaha S-400, and a Yamaha C7. Maybeck originally designed the space to accommodate an 1898 7-foot Bechstein. In 1923, the hall was destroyed in a hillside fire. It was rebuilt quickly by Maybeck. Milda Nixon lived at the residence until her death in 1981 at the age of 92. Her adopted son, Charles R. Fulweiler, Phd., then held the house for several years. In 1987, the house was purchased by jazz pianist Dick Whittington, who opened the hall for public recitals. Between 1989 and 1995, Concord Records produced 42 solo piano recitals in Maybeck Recital Hall. Each recital featured a different jazz pianist, and all 42 recordings were released on CD. Concord also recorded 10 jazz duets at Maybeck during the same time period, which were also released as a series of CDs sold by Concord. In 1996, the house was purchased by Gregory Moore.

Born to a prosperous family in Koprivshtitsa, Bulgaria, he experienced hardship upon the death of his father in 1896, which necessitated the family moving to Plovdiv, and then onto Sofia in 1904. Debelyanov always spoke of the eight years in Plovdiv with regret, calling it \"the sorrowful city\". In 1906, he began to send poetry to Bulgarian literary magazines at the urging of Pencho Slaveikov, where he saw his first printed works, which were well received. He moved from job to job during the next six years, unable to settle and seeing employment as a junior clerk for the central meteorological station and as a freelance journalist, before joining the army in 1912 to fight in the Balkan Wars. In 1914 he was discharged from the army and took up a post in an office, a position he hated so much, that he rejoined the army in 1916, but was killed near Gorno Karadjovo during a battle with an Irish division. His body was buried in Valovishta, today Sidirokastro, Greece. His mortal remains were carried in his native town Koprivshtitsa in 1931. His body of work was collected by friends following his death and published in a two volume anthology with a collection of letters and personal writings. These became very popular in post-war Bulgaria, critics commenting that they reflect the poet remarkably well, being in a Symbolist style and thus unable to settle on a theme, focusing most closely on the presence of death and despair, creating a \"gloomy melancholy\" effect.", "passages": [{"passageId": "18284:1181:1254", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 1181, "passageEnd": 1254, "passageText": "His mortal remains were carried in his native town Koprivshtitsa in 1931.", "facts": []}]}

Since ending her reign, Umeh-Akamune has used the pageant's exposure to pursue a career in modelling and singing, and had worked in public relations promoting cosmetic brand IKB.

It is one of the largest summer theatres in Finland and has been running uninterrupted longer than any other open-air theatre in the country. The theatre was founded in 1948 and was originally named Tampereen Kes\u00e4teatteri (Tampere Summer Theatre). It started operating in Joselininniemi, on the shore of the lake Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, where the performances continue to be held until today. In 1955 the name of the theatre was changed to Pyynikin Kes\u00e4teatteri. The theatre increased its popularity throughout the latter half of the 1950s. The construction of the rotating auditorium, designed by the architect Reijo Ojanen and holding 800 seats, was completed in 1959. The real breakthrough for Pyynikin Kes\u00e4teatteri came in the 1960s with the play Tuntematon sotilas (The Unknown Soldier). This stage adaptation of the novel by V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna became hugely popular and remained in the repertoire for nearly a decade. The revolving auditorium was fully renovated in the mid-1990s, when the number of seats was increased to 836. Since January 2001, the theatre has been run by Pyynikin Kes\u00e4teatteris\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6 (Pyynikki Summer Theatre Foundation). In 2005 a roof for the auditorium was completed, thus lengthening the usability of the theatre in spring and autumn in the Nordic weather conditions. Tampereen Teatterikerho, which managed the theatre before the foundation was formed, has been an important influence in the cultural life of Tampere, because its support enabled the founding of Tampereen Teatterikes\u00e4 (Tampere Theatre Festival) in 1969 and Teatteri 2000 in 1985.", "passages": [{"passageId": "16024:314:419", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 314, "passageEnd": 419, "passageText": "The theatre was founded in 1948 and was originally named Tampereen Kes\u00e4teatteri (Tampere Summer Theatre).", "facts": []}]}

Millikan graduated from Oberlin College in 1891 and obtained his doctorate at Columbia University in 1895. In 1896 he became an assistant at the University of Chicago, where he became a full professor in 1910. In 1909 Millikan began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electric field. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his famous oil-drop experiment in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with oil. In 1914 Millikan took up with similar skill the experimental verification of the equation introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 to describe the photoelectric effect. He used this same research to obtain an accurate value of Planck\u2019s constant. In 1921 Millikan left the University of Chicago to become director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. There he undertook a major study of the radiation that the physicist Victor Hess had detected coming from outer space. Millikan proved that this radiation is indeed of extraterrestrial origin, and he named it \"cosmic rays.\" As chairman of the Executive Council of Caltech (the school's governing body at the time) from 1921 until his retirement in 1945, Millikan helped to turn the school into one of the leading research institutions in the United States.

It soon became a thriving wholesale business with deliveries being made by horse and buggy. Abraham's son Louis would go on to take over the business from his father, owning the building the bakery was housed in. Louis would go on to perfect the formulas of his father, while reinventing the breads sold. It is claimed that it was Louis who invented Raisin Pumpernickel bread, at Orwasher's during World War II. Abram Orwasher, Louis's son, later took over the business, using the same brick ovens and sourdough starter that was used in 1916. In 2007, Mr. Orwasher sold the bakery to Keith Cohen, who stated plans to expand the bakery's offerings beyond Eastern European breads, adding artisanal breads from Italy, France, Ireland and the United States. Starting in 2009, Keith Cohen launched a new line of Artisan Wine Breads under the brand name Oven Artisans.

Jarrow of Kamakura Corporation and Cornell University and Stuart Turnbull, currently at the University of Houston. Many experts in financial theory label the Jarrow\u2013Turnbull model as the first \"reduced-form\" credit model. Reduced-form models are an approach to credit risk modeling that contrasts sharply with the \"structural credit models\". The structural or \"Merton\" credit models are single-period models which derive the probability of default from the random variation in the unobservable value of the firm's assets. Two years after the development of the structural credit model, Robert Merton modeled bankruptcy as a continuous probability of default. Upon the random occurrence of default, the stock price of the defaulting company is assumed to go to zero. Merton derived the value of options for a company that can default. This was in fact the first \"reduced form\" model where bankruptcy is modeled as a statistical process, rather than as a microeconomic model of the firm's capital structure.[citation needed] The Jarrow\u2013Turnbull model extends the reduced-form model of Merton (1976) to a random interest rates framework. Large financial institutions employ default models of both the structural and reduced form types. The Merton structural default probabilities were first offered by KMV LLC in the early 1990s. KMV LLC was acquired by Moody's Investors Service in 2002. Kamakura Corporation, where Robert Jarrow serves as director of research, has offered both structural and reduced form default probabilities on public companies since 2002.[citation needed]", "passages": [{"passageId": "19036:1093:1222", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 1093, "passageEnd": 1222, "passageText": "[citation needed] The Jarrow\u2013Turnbull model extends the reduced-form model of Merton (1976) to a random interest rates framework.", "facts": []}]}

Robertson, the son of the Rev. John Robertson, was born at Halstead, Essex, England. He was educated at the Southwestern Academy, Glasgow and trained as a bookseller with James Maclehose, bookseller to the University of Glasgow.[citation needed] He emigrated to New Zealand as a young man, and, two years later (in 1882), he relocated to Sydney, where he found employment at the local branch of George Robertson and Company, booksellers of Melbourne. He was in no way related to the founder of that firm. In January 1886 he joined D. M. Angus in partnership, at first in Market Street, Sydney and later, in Castlereagh Street. After Angus' death in 1900 Robertson continued in partnership with Frederick Wymark and Richard Thomson who had acquired Angus' share of the business, until in 1907 the partnership was converted into a public company and continues under the name of Angus & Robertson Ltd. Around 1895 the publishing side of the business began to be developed and many successful volumes were launched. Among the earlier authors were Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson and Victor Daley. Robertson could recognize quickly a promising author and was willing to take considerable risks in backing his judgment. During the last 30 years of his life the number of volumes he published exceeded the total number brought out in the same period by all the other publishers in Australia. The Australian Encyclopaedia, published in two volumes in 1926, is one of the most important books published in Australia.[citation needed] He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Stewart Bruce in 1881, and, in 1910, to Eva Adeline Ducat.

Ada Chard Williams wrote a letter to the police denying the crime but in effect admitting she was a baby farmer who bought and sold babies for profit. The police soon discovered that Mrs Hewetson was Ada Chard Williams. However, they had no body with which to prove there had been a murder, at least not until Selina's corpse was washed up on the bank of the Thames at Battersea. Like Amelia Dyer, Ada Chard Williams had her own \"signature\" way of tying up bodies she wished to dispose of, using a knot called a Fisherman's knot or bend and which was a crucial piece of evidence at her trial at the Old Bailey on 16 and 17 February 1900.

Many critics praised her bel canto technique, wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations. Her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto operas of Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini and further, to the works of Verdi and Puccini; and, in her early career, to the music dramas of Wagner. Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as La Divina. Born in New York City and raised by an overbearing mother, she received her musical education in Greece and established her career in Italy. Forced to deal with the exigencies of wartime poverty and with myopia that left her nearly blind onstage, she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career. She turned herself from a heavy woman into a svelte and glamorous one after a mid-career weight loss, which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career. The press exulted in publicizing Callas's temperamental behavior, her with Renata Tebaldi and her love affair with Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis.

In 1816 he was appointed head of 'antiquarian' collections which later developed into the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. While organizing and classifying the antiquities for exhibition, he decided to present them chronologically according to the three-age system. Other scholars had previously proposed that prehistory had advanced from an age of stone tools, to ages of tools made from bronze and iron, but these proposals were presented as systems of evolution, which did not allow dating of artifacts. Thomsen refined the three-age system as a chronological system by seeing which artifacts occurred with which other artifacts in closed finds. In this way, he was the first to establish an evidence-based division of prehistory into discrete periods. This achievement led to his being credited as the originator of the three-age system of European antiquity. Thomsen also wrote one of the first systematic treatises on gold bracteates of the Migration period. Thomsen's study of artifacts within the Copenhagen museum were based on associations between stylistic change, decoration and context; he recognised the importance of examining objects from \"closed finds\", allowing him to determine the associations of common artifacts for various periods (stone - bronze - iron). His results were published in the Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed (Guideline to Scandinavian Antiquity) in 1836.

A Queensland State of Origin representative half back, he played his club football in Australasia's National Rugby League (NRL) for the Brisbane Broncos (with whom he won the 2006 NRL Premiership) and Parramatta Eels, as well as in Europe's Super League for the Catalans Dragons. McGuire made his NRL debut for Parramatta in 1998. The next season he returned to Queensland to play for Brisbane. At the Broncos he was a utility player, normally used in games from the bench. He achieved selection for the Queensland Maroons in 2005. Selected to play from the interchange bench in the 2006 NRL Grand Final, McGuire's last game for the Broncos, he threw a miracle pass which contributed to Brisbane's match-winning try. The next season he moved to France to play in Super League for Les Catalans. Having initially started playing the halves at Les Catalans, McGuire increasingly found himself playing at hooker and sharing much of the creative responsibilities with Adam Mogg and Thomas Bosc. He became a key figure in the side. He had also been named in the France squad for the Four Nations tournament, qualifying under the three-year residency rule, but did not play. McGuire returned to Australia and the club where he made his NRL debut when he joined Parramatta for the 2011 season, playing as five-eighth. He has been one of the shining lights in what has otherwise been a season of unrelenting disappointment at Parramatta, which has netted just five wins and a draw. He has only missed a small number of games since returning to the NRL. A pectoral muscle injury during the 2012 NRL season put the remainder of McGuire's playing career in doubt.", "passages": [{"passageId": "8866:15:166", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "45", "propertyName": "POLITICAL_AFFILIATION", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and her/his political affiliation."}, {"propertyId": "12", "propertyName": "PLACE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the location where she/he was born."}, {"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 15, "passageEnd": 166, "passageText": "Casey McGuire (born 24 January 1980 in Nambour, Queensland) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer of the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.", "facts": [{"factId": "8866:15:28:63:73:12", "propertyId": "12", "humanReadable": "<Casey McGuire> <PLACE_OF_BIRTH> <Queensland>", "annotatedPassage": "<Casey McGuire> (born 24 January 1980 in Nambour, <Queensland>) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer of the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.", "subjectStart": 15, "subjectEnd": 28, "subjectText": "Casey McGuire", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2940989", "objectStart": 63, "objectEnd": 73, "objectText": "Queensland", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q36074"}, {"factId": "8866:15:28:54:61:12", "propertyId": "12", "humanReadable": "<Casey McGuire> <PLACE_OF_BIRTH> <Nambour>", "annotatedPassage": "<Casey McGuire> (born 24 January 1980 in <Nambour>, Queensland) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer of the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.", "subjectStart": 15, "subjectEnd": 28, "subjectText": "Casey McGuire", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2940989", "objectStart": 54, "objectEnd": 61, "objectText": "Nambour", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1343166"}, {"factId": "8866:15:28:35:50:15", "propertyId": "15", "humanReadable": "<Casey McGuire> <DATE_OF_BIRTH> <24 January 1980>", "annotatedPassage": "<Casey McGuire> (born <24 January 1980> in Nambour, Queensland) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer of the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.", "subjectStart": 15, "subjectEnd": 28, "subjectText": "Casey McGuire", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2940989", "objectStart": 35, "objectEnd": 50, "objectText": "24 January 1980", "objectUri": ""}]}]}

Humble grew up in Texas and was a mult-sport athlete at his San Antonio high school. He enrolled at Rice University in Houston, Texas in 1940 and played three seasons on the school's football team. Humble then spent three years in the U.S. Marines during World War II, serving in the Pacific War and earning a Bronze Star Medal before returning to complete his college studies in 1946. Sportswriters named him a first-team All-American after the Rice Owls finished with an 8\u20132 win\u2013loss record and beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl. The AAFC's Baltimore Colts signed Humble in 1947, but the Browns acquired him in a trade before the season. Humble became an anchor on Cleveland's offensive line, helping the team win three straight AAFC titles in the late 1940s. When the AAFC dissolved in 1949, Cleveland moved to the NFL and won another championship in 1950. Humble, who remained in the Marine Reserves, was called into service in the Korean War after the season. He was expected to return to Cleveland the following year, but head coach Paul Brown traded him to the Texans before the 1952 season began. He retired after one year in Dallas. After his playing career, Humble worked as a bank executive and at an office supply company. He was also the chairman of the selection committee for the Bluebonnet Bowl. Humble was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1961, and was named to the Texas Sports Hall of Fame and the South Texas Football Hall of Fame in 1969.

The property has been owned by the National Trust since 1960 when the Holbech family endowed it to them, and is still run and lived in by Geoffrey Holbech's daughter Caroline Beddall and her family. It is a Grade I listed building. The Holbech family acquired the Farnborough estate in 1684 and the honey-coloured two-storey stone house was built soon after. Major changes to the property occurred between 1745 and 1750 when the entrance front was remodelled and the rococo plasterwork was added to the interior. This work was carried out by William Holbech who wanted a suitable setting for the sculpture and art he had brought back from his Grand Tour. He most likely used designs by his close friend Sanderson Miller, an architect, who lived a few miles away. Long Palladian facades with sash windows, pedimented doorways and a balustraded roofline were added to the earlier classical west front. Unlike many of its contemporaries, Farnborough Hall and its landscaped gardens have experienced little alteration in the last 200 years and they remain largely as William Holbech left them. The entrance opens straight into the Italianate hall. The walls are adorned with busts of Roman emperors set into oval niches and the panelled ceiling is stuccoed with rococo motifs. The dining room on the south front was especially designed to display works by Canaletto and Giovanni Paolo Panini. The original works are long gone, being replaced by copies. The drawing room has panels of elaborate stuccowork featuring scrolls, shells, fruit and flowers; these serve as a framework for more Italian works of art.

Not as a substitute for parenting, but as another voice of reason and developing respectful young men/women.    Some will say that soccer is a microcosm of life.

Soon after, she was appointed Professor of Anatomy at the Academy of Sciences of Bologna Institute. In 1757 Galli was made Professor of Obstetrics at the Bologna Institute in the Palazzo Poggi,and the next year Pope Benedict XIV overrode opposition and established a school of obstetrics at the Institute.The Pope acquired Galli's collection of teaching models for use in the Institute's school.Galli's first twenty models were made by the Manzolinis,and eventually the institute would have over 150 obstetrical models.Galli invented a machine to simulate the birthing process for teaching medical students and midwives.Galli's school was unusual in combining theory and practice in his teaching method,and at that time unusual in teaching the subject in a medical and surgical school.

{"fold": 4, "source": "DBpedia Abstract", "documentId": "8016", "documentText": "Thomas Elsbeth\n\nThomas Elsbeth (? - after 1624) was a German composer. Details of Elsbeth's life are few and vague. Elsbeth was born in Neustadt, Franconia; his birth date is totally unknown, although he did refer to himself as \"poor and old\" in 1616. Since his early publications were issued in Frankfurt an der Oder, he is thought to have been an acquaintance of Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius, the kantor there. He may have attended Viadrina University in Frankfurt, though modern scholars have been unable to substantiate this with archival research. He dedicated a publication to the city councilmen of Breslau, and may have spent time there. He also published several books of works in Liegnitz after 1606, and so it is probable that he lived there for some time. However, he is not listed in any of the surviving city payrolls. He is presumed to have lived in Jauer from 1616, and probably died there in or after 1624, the date of his last publications. Elsbeth left a significant body of extant motets and songs. Elsbeth's songs, of which there are about 100, are for three to five voices; some are in a homophonic style and others are set in a polyphonic chorale style. He never took up use of the basso continuo, despite its increasing popularity via Italy in the beginning of the 17th century. Of about 150 motets, most of the early works are in Latin and most of the later in German. His Evangelien collections are calendrical settings of the Gospels, which together cover the entire church year.

The museum opened in 1978, the 250th anniversary of the birth in the same spot of British naval explorer and circumnavigator Captain James Cook. A biographical museum, it champions and surveys his life, times and subsequent journeys. Prior to its existence, visitors to the Park had long already been enlightened as to the location's historical significance by the erection by local industrialist and mayor Henry Bolckow of a granite urnin the 1850s bearing Cook's name, within what were then the grounds of his own residence, Marton Hall.Marton Hall was destroyed by fire in 1960 during demolition, with only a surviving stone loggiaa telltale sign as to its former existence. The museum itself comprises some of the modest Cook-related collections outside of the ownership of the major national and international collections; including household items and a speculative reconstruction of the birthplace cottage that was swept away amid the landscaping process for the Marton Lodge, home to the Rudd family, which stood here until 1793.Also on call to the visitor are a series of interactive displays and temporary travelling exhibitions as well as a cafe, gift shop, education suite and resources and archive room. A second major refurbishment was undertaken in 1998 whereupon Sir David Attenborough reopened it to the public. External to the museum can be found an information board in deference to Marton's position as the starting point for the 'Captain Cook Country Tour', a product of the Cleveland-wide Captain Cook Tourism Association.", "passages": [{"passageId": "28725:1065:1424", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 1065, "passageEnd": 1424, "passageText": "The museum itself comprises some of the modest Cook-related collections outside of the ownership of the major national and international collections; including household items and a speculative reconstruction of the birthplace cottage that was swept away amid the landscaping process for the Marton Lodge, home to the Rudd family, which stood here until 1793.", "facts": []}]}

Although Sikorski made his MLB debut in 2000, he didn't play another game in the big leagues until 2006. He played professional baseball in Japan for five years, until 2005 for the Yomiuri Giants. The Cleveland Indians acquired Sikorski in a trade July 18, 2006, by sending right-handed pitcher Mike Adams to the San Diego Padres. On May 17, 2007, Sikorski's contract was sold to the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. He signed to play for the Chiba Lotte Marines in 2008. After two more seasons with the Marines, Sikorski signed a contract with the Saitama Seibu Lions to be the team's closer in 2010. Securing the closer spot for the first time in his Japanese career, Sikorski responded, as of August 29, 2010, he leads the Pacific League in saves with 30, and he did not blow a save until August 20 against the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. Until the 2010 season, Sikorski's record for saves was 15; this was broken on May 25 against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. Sikorski attended Western Michigan University and obtained a degree in criminology. Brian was drafted in the fourth round of the 1995 amateur entry draft by the Houston Astros. Like many pitchers, Sikorski is known for his strict adherence to his pre-pitching routine. Two of his most noticeable routines are how he vigorously swings his right (pitching) arm in a windmill-style circle, both forwards and backwards before throwing his warmup pitches. Also, after getting the third out of the inning, he sprints off the mound and jumps over the foul line on the way to his team's dugout, resulting in him usually being the first one in.", "passages": [{"passageId": "18655:1070:1153", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "9", "propertyName": "EDUCATED_AT", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the institution where she/he studied."}], "passageStart": 1070, "passageEnd": 1153, "passageText": "Sikorski attended Western Michigan University and obtained a degree in criminology.", "facts": [{"factId": "18655:1070:1078:1088:1115:9", "propertyId": "9", "humanReadable": "<Sikorski> <EDUCATED_AT> <Western Michigan University>", "annotatedPassage": "<Sikorski> attended <Western Michigan University> and obtained a degree in criminology.", "subjectStart": 1070, "subjectEnd": 1078, "subjectText": "Sikorski", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4965300", "objectStart": 1088, "objectEnd": 1115, "objectText": "Western Michigan University", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1546191"}]}]}

She was the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. In 1802, age thirteen, she married her first cousin Francis, Crown Prince of Naples, who was a widower. The following years were marked by the Napoleonic Wars that affected the Italian Peninsula. In 1806, she had to flee Naples for Sicily with the rest of the Neapolitan royal family. She lived with her husband in Palermo until 1820. She was good nature and pliable and was well matched with her husband. Theirs was a happy marriage that produced thirteen children. Mar\u00eda Isabella lacked political acumen and had no ambitions, but unlike her powerful mother in law, Maria Carolina of Austria, she was popular. In 1825 her husband ascended to the throne as King Francis I of the Two Sicilies. During his reign, she did not play any political role, but was well liked for her simple manners and generosity. She visited her native Spain in 1830 when her second daughter Maria Christina married King Ferdinand VII of Spain. Shortly after their return to Naples, her husband died in November 1830. As a Queen mother, she remained a popular figure.

She was initially recognised for her collaborations with William Orbit, Red Snapper and the Chemical Brothers in the mid-1990s. She released a solo album in 1993, Superpinkymandy (produced by William Orbit), but since the album was only released in Japan, it went largely unnoticed by international audiences. Her second solo album, Trailer Park, garnered much critical acclaim in 1996. Orton developed a devoted audience with the release of the albums Central Reservation (1999) and the 2002 UK top 10 album, Daybreaker. In her 2006 release, Comfort of Strangers, she moved towards a more folk-based sound and away from the electronic sound of her past albums. American films and television programmes such as Felicity, How to Deal, Charmed, Dawson's Creek, Vanilla Sky and Grey's Anatomy have featured her music and provided her with exposure to a more mainstream American audience.", "passages": [{"passageId": "8103:12:181", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 12, "passageEnd": 181, "passageText": "Elizabeth Caroline \"Beth\" Orton (born 14 December 1970) is an English singer-songwriter, known for her 'folktronica' sound, which mixes elements of folk and electronica.", "facts": [{"factId": "8103:12:43:50:66:15", "propertyId": "15", "humanReadable": "<Elizabeth Caroline \"Beth\" Orton> <DATE_OF_BIRTH> <14 December 1970>", "annotatedPassage": "<Elizabeth Caroline \"Beth\" Orton> (born <14 December 1970>) is an English singer-songwriter, known for her 'folktronica' sound, which mixes elements of folk and electronica.", "subjectStart": 12, "subjectEnd": 43, "subjectText": "Elizabeth Caroline \"Beth\" Orton", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q465296", "objectStart": 50, "objectEnd": 66, "objectText": "14 December 1970", "objectUri": ""}, {"factId": "8103:111:114:50:66:15", "propertyId": "15", "humanReadable": "<her> <DATE_OF_BIRTH> <14 December 1970>", "annotatedPassage": "Elizabeth Caroline \"Beth\" Orton (born <14 December 1970>) is an English singer-songwriter, known for <her> 'folktronica' sound, which mixes elements of folk and electronica.", "subjectStart": 111, "subjectEnd": 114, "subjectText": "her", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q465296", "objectStart": 50, "objectEnd": 66, "objectText": "14 December 1970", "objectUri": ""}]}]}

Deciding on a break from city life I moved to Wimbledon and joined a local IT professional services company, but after only 2 years I was approached to join a specialist IT company as bid writer, progressing on to bid manager and later covering internal communications and CSR, where I discovered my interest in HR. Having always had an interest in HR and after 9 years in IT recruitment I welcomed the move and joined Oakleaf in January on a part-time basis as PSL and project co-ordinator, where I will focus on all tender management, PSL and business contracts, extensions as well as managing all ad-hoc projects.\nOutside of work, I have a keen passion for health and fitness. I\u2019m a qualified fitness instructor and enjoy all types of sporting activities. Each year I try to participate in various events to raise funds and awareness for charity. I\u2019ve completed 3 marathons and plan to complete a further 2! In 2014 I cycled across 6 cities, totalling around 700 miles.

Smith, Jr.\n\nJohn Francis \"Jack\" Smith, Jr. (born April 6, 1938) is the non-executive chairman of the board of directors of Delta Air Lines. Smith has been a member of Delta's board of directors since 2000. From 1996 to 2003, Smith was chairman of the board of directors of General Motors, and was that company's CEO from 1992 to 2000. Smith was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. He joined General Motors as a payroll auditor in 1961, moving to its financial group in New York City in 1966. He went on to hold positions ranging from director of international planning to president of GM Canada, president of GM Europe and head of international operations. As CEO of GM, he undertook one of its most sweeping reorganizations, overturning a cumbersome and inefficient structure created in the 1920s by Alfred P. Sloan and left virtually unchanged since then. Starting with purchasing in 1992 and ending with engineering in 2003, he brought together separate overlapping functions related to the various divisions that formed the company, while also expanding operations into Asia. In this transformation, which included terminating the Oldsmobile brand, over 90% of core management positions were eliminated, corporate decision-making became faster and easier, production efficiencies and quality improved, and, above all, the bottom line went from near-bankruptcy losses to decent profits. After he relinquished the CEO position in 2000 to his personally selected successor, Rick Wagoner, he continued on as Chairman to see his plan fully executed. Along with his chairmanship of Delta, Smith is currently a director of several other entities, including Procter & Gamble and The Nature Conservancy. Smith is a trustee of Boston University.

Boos came from a gardening family that lived in the Grand Duchy of Baden, his father being head gardener in Rastatt, his son Joseph Boos (1794\u20131879) being an assistant gardener at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace. Franz began his career in 1771 as a gardener to Prince Leopold of Dietrichstein in Seelowitz (Moravia). From 1774 to 1775 he worked at the famous gardens of Prince Johann I of Liechtenstein in Lednice (also in Moravia) then, in 1776, he became assistant gardener at the Imperial and Royal Court Gardens of Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna. Franz Boos is best known for successful voyages to America, the Caribbean and South Africa during which he collected a wide range of natural history specimens for the parks and gardens, menagerie, and Cabinet of the Emperor's palace at Sch\u00f6nbrunn. The Emperor had appointed Franz Joseph M\u00e4rter (1753-1827) as organiser and leader of this voyage of scientific exploration. Franz Boos, an under-gardener at the time, was selected as the primary collector specialising in tropical plants for the greenhouses. When Boos sailed to the Isle de France (now Mauritius) and Bourbon (Reunion), he was a passenger of the then unknown merchant sailor Nicolas Baudin. The knowledge gained from Austrian Boos was later combined with French horticultural and botanical expertise which lead Baudin to the forefront of scientific exploration and research as the century moved into the upheaval of Revolutionary Wars. He worked at the Jardin du Roi, Pamplemousses, with Nicolas C\u00e9r\u00e9 and at Palma with Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Charpentier de Cossigny.

This flexibility is produced by a system of acoustic curtains and a special false ceiling design called a black-hole, which absorbs most of the acoustic reflections of the hall.

The film was directed and co-written by Pete Docter, co-directed and co-written by Ronnie del Carmen and produced by Jonas Rivera, with music composed by Michael Giacchino.

Docter first began developing Inside Out in 2009 after noticing changes in his daughter's personality as she grew older. The film's producers consulted numerous psychologists, including Dacher Keltner from the University of California, Berkeley, who helped revise the story by emphasizing the neuropsychological findings that human emotions affect interpersonal relationships and can be significantly moderated by them. After premiering at the 68th Cannes Film Festival in May, Inside Out was released in North America on June 19, 2015, accompanied by the short film Lava directed by James Ford Murphy. Critics praised the film's concept, screenplay, subject matter, musical score, and the vocal performances\u2014particularly for Poehler, Smith, and Richard Kind.

His wife was Ilione, the eldest daughter of King Priam. Polymestor appears in Euripides' play, Hecuba and in the Ovidian myth \"Hecuba, Polyxena and Polydorus\". Polymestor was also a Greek king of Arcadia. During the Trojan War, King Priam was frightened for his youngest son Polydorus's safety since Polydorus could not fight for himself. Priam sent the child, along with gifts of jewelry and gold, to the court of King Polymestor to keep him away from the fighting. After Troy fell, Polymestor betrayed Priam and threw Polydorus into the ocean in order to keep the treasure for himself. Hecuba, Polydorus' mother, found the body and discovered the treachery. She asked Agamemnon to bring Polymestor to her. Agamemnon complied, motivated by the love of Cassandra, another of Hecuba's children. Hecuba baits Polymestor by drawing him in with treasure. Hecuba has the other Trojan women kill Polymestor's sons, and blinds Polymestor by scratching his eyes out. Polymestor is humiliated at having been blinded and made childless at the hands of slave women. Polymestor is given a trial against Hecuba by Agamemnon. Polymestor claims to be working in the Greek's interest by killing Polydorus before he avenges his brothers and father. Hecuba refutes this claim by stating that Greece has no interest in allying with barbarians. Agamemnon sides with Hecuba and declares Polymestor's actions to be murder. Agamemnon has his soldiers seize Polymestor.

{"fold": 4, "source": "DBpedia Abstract", "documentId": "7970", "documentText": "Adam Smith\n\nAdam Smith (16 June 1723 NS \u2013 17 July 1790) was a Scottish moral philosopher, pioneer of political economy, and a key figure in the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith is best known for two classic works: The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. Smith is cited as the father of modern economics and is still among the most influential thinkers in the field of economics today. Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot, John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity.

Born in England, Stanley was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, and worked in the foreign service in Dresden and Coburg before serving as the Resident Commissioner for Southern and Northern Rhodesia from 1911 to 1914. Stanley proved controversial in this role when he refused to allow settlers to take land from Africans, instead assigning 21,500,000 acres (87,000 km2) in perpetuity exclusively for the use of Africans. Based in South Africa during World War I, Stanley married Reniera Cloete, from a leading Cape Town family, in Cape Town in 1918. She was described as \"one of the most beautiful women of the century in any country of the world\". In 1918, Stanley was appointed Imperial Secretary in South Africa, a position he held until 1924, when he was appointed the inaugural Governor of Northern Rhodesia. As Governor, Stanley sought an amalgamation of the central African colonies and an extension of the Northern Rhodesian railway into Southern Rhodesia. In 1927, Stanley was transferred to Ceylon as its Governor, which drew criticism due to his lack of background knowledge of Asian affairs, although he is reported to have acquitted himself well. He returned to Africa in 1931 to serve as High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in South Africa before his appointment as Governor of Southern Rhodesia in 1935, initially for a two-year term, but he was persuaded to remain in Salisbury until 1942, when he retired from active service. Upon his retirement, Stanley settled in Cape Town and was appointed Chief Commissioner of the South African Boy Scouts. He died a widower in a Cape Town nursing home, aged 82, survived by two sons and two daughters.", "passages": [{"passageId": "8006:209:445", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "9", "propertyName": "EDUCATED_AT", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the institution where she/he studied."}, {"propertyId": "10", "propertyName": "NATIONALITY", "propertyDescription": "Describes he country of a person's citizenship or country in which the person is deemed a national."}, {"propertyId": "11", "propertyName": "PLACE_OF_RESIDENCE", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the location where she/he lives/lived."}], "passageStart": 209, "passageEnd": 445, "passageText": "Born in England, Stanley was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, and worked in the foreign service in Dresden and Coburg before serving as the Resident Commissioner for Southern and Northern Rhodesia from 1911 to 1914.", "facts": [{"factId": "8006:226:233:250:262:9", "propertyId": "9", "humanReadable": "<Stanley> <EDUCATED_AT> <Eton College>", "annotatedPassage": "Born in England, <Stanley> was educated at <Eton College> and Balliol College, Oxford, and worked in the foreign service in Dresden and Coburg before serving as the Resident Commissioner for Southern and Northern Rhodesia from 1911 to 1914.", "subjectStart": 226, "subjectEnd": 233, "subjectText": "Stanley", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q14945531", "objectStart": 250, "objectEnd": 262, "objectText": "Eton College", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q192088"}, {"factId": "8006:226:233:267:282:9", "propertyId": "9", "humanReadable": "<Stanley> <EDUCATED_AT> <Balliol College>", "annotatedPassage": "Born in England, <Stanley> was educated at Eton College and <Balliol College>, Oxford, and worked in the foreign service in Dresden and Coburg before serving as the Resident Commissioner for Southern and Northern Rhodesia from 1911 to 1914.", "subjectStart": 226, "subjectEnd": 233, "subjectText": "Stanley", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q14945531", "objectStart": 267, "objectEnd": 282, "objectText": "Balliol College", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q805285"}]}]}

Her single from the album, \"For Life\", was voted unanimous winner of Piosenka dla Europy, the Polish final for the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. Tamara and her song \"For Life\" was the first Polish entry in history to qualify for the Eurovision final since the new rules were designed in the contest and a French television commentator compared Gee's performance to Celine Dion. A portion of Gee's Eurovision performance was shown on The Oprah Winfrey Show on the \"The World's Got Talent'\" episode with Simon Cowell where Gee was shown singing amidst legendary former participants Celine Dion, Abba and Julio Iglesias. In 2007 Gee co-wrote and performed \"Fate\" on DJ Schiller's album Sehnsucht. The album went triple platinum and was nominated for a Grammy. She released her solo EP Christmas Angel in 2009.

He did not attend school but worked in the Bogan River district as a shearer, wool-presser, sawmiller, tree-feller, fencer and miner. In 1905 he joined the Australian Workers' Union (AWU), and was later employed as a clerk in Sydney. He married Amy Forrest, a dressmaker, at the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Waterloo on 13 April 1914. An organiser for the AWU from 1920, he moved to Queensland in search of work in 1923. In 1924 Boland was the AWU's Western District organiser, holding various positions until becoming Far Northern District secretary in 1941. He was elected Queensland president of the AWU in 1947 and Queensland president of the Australian Labor Party in 1950, joining the federal executive. Boland, who also chaired the union's newspaper the Worker, was one of six Queensland delegates to the 1955 ALP federal conference in Hobart, where he was left to represent his state alone after the other five delegates, who included Premier Vince Gair and state treasurer Ted Walsh, boycotted the conference over a dispute concerning the Victorian delegation. Boland was an opponent of the Industrial Groups and supported the conference's resolution to withdraw party support from them. The anti-Grouper attack in Queensland was led by AWU president Joe Bukowski, allowing Boland to retain friendly relations with Gair and the others. He worked unsuccessfully to avoid the deepening divisions that in 1957 led to the formation of the Queensland Labor Party. Boland, however, did not live to see his party divide, dying in 1956 at Tingalpa of a coronary occlusion.", "passages": [{"passageId": "25851:31:131", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 31, "passageEnd": 131, "passageText": "Harold \"Harry\" Boland (21 October 1891 \u2013 25 July 1956) was an Australian shearer and trade unionist.", "facts": [{"factId": "25851:31:52:54:69:15", "propertyId": "15", "humanReadable": "<Harold \"Harry\" Boland> <DATE_OF_BIRTH> <21 October 1891>", "annotatedPassage": "<Harold \"Harry\" Boland> (<21 October 1891> \u2013 25 July 1956) was an Australian shearer and trade unionist.", "subjectStart": 31, "subjectEnd": 52, "subjectText": "Harold \"Harry\" Boland", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 54, "objectEnd": 69, "objectText": "21 October 1891", "objectUri": ""}]}]}

Watson was born in Milwaukee and grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. He was educated at Brownell-Talbot, Harvard, and the University of California at San Diego, where he took his degree in engineering. He has won many chess tournaments including the first US National High School Chess Championship and the American Open. Watson is best known as a chess theorist and author, and has written more than thirty books on many aspects of chess. His 1999 book Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy won the British Chess Federation's Book of the year award as well as the United States Chess Federation Book of the Year. The successor volume Chess Strategy in Action was the Chesscafe Book of the Year. These two books explore and theorize how radically chess has changed since the early 20th century, and how old and supposedly 'time-tested' rules for the conduct of play have been replaced by broader and revolutionary practice over-the-board. These books have been translated into several languages. In a lighter vein, Watson wrote the Chessman comic book series, illustrated by Chris Hendrickson and Svein Myreng. Chessman Comics are now out-of-print collectors' items. Watson has a regular book review column at The Week in Chess, the publication of the London Chess Centre (available online). He has a weekly Internet radio show 'Chess Talk with John Watson' on Chess.FM, the radio arm of the Internet Chess Club (ICC). Watson is also much in demand as a chess coach; his students have included Tal Shaked, the 1997 World Junior Champion, Senior Master Patrick Hummel, Abby Marshall, and also other US scholastic champions.

He was born in East Flamboro Township, Wentworth County, Canada West, the son of George Chisholm. After the death of his parents, Chisholm farmed for a number of years. In 1837, he sold the farm and studied for two years at Victoria College in Cobourg. Chisholm studied law with Miles O'Reilly in Hamilton, was called to the bar in 1864 and set up practice in Hamilton. In 1864, he married Addie Davis; Chisholm and his wife were both involved in the temperance movement in Hamilton. He was president of the Standard Fire Insurance Company, the Alliance Insurance Company and the Canada Loan and Banking Company. Chisholm was also Chairman of the Provincial Board of Directors for the Hamilton and North Western Railway and served as a major in the militia.

Brightwell was born in Rawalpindi, British India, but moved to the UK with his family in 1946 and grew up in Donnington, Shropshire. He gained his athletic training at Shrewsbury Technical College and went on to become a sportsmaster at Tiffin Boys' School in Surrey, England. He was known for his quarter-mile running races, with his first major race taking place during 1961. He broke the British record for 440 yards as well as the European 400 metres record. During the Olympic Games held in Tokyo, he was captain of the men's British Olympic Team. Running the final stage in the men's 4 x 400 metres relay, he passed Wendell Mottley of Trinidad & Tobago to finish second to Henry Carr of the USA. In the individual 400 metres he finished fourth. His fianc\u00e9e at that time was Ann Packer who won a gold medal in the women's 800 metres (run) on the day after the men's individual 400 metres final. After winning a silver medal in the 400 metres Packer had no plans to run in the 800 metres and had a shopping trip planned until Brightwell's disappointing 400 metres. She said she ran it for him and broke the world record in the process. The captaincy of the British Team and his silver medal was the climax of his career. Aged only 24 years early in 1964 he announced that he would retire after the Olympic Games. He and Packer were each awarded the MBE in 1965. Brightwell and Packer were married on 19 December 1964 and had three sons: Gary, and two former Manchester City players Ian and David.

In 1993, he entered the University of Manitoba where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts-Honors degree. He is the recipient of two University of Manitoba Gold Medals, a Shanski Fine Arts Bursary, two Heins Jordan Awards and an undergraduate scholarship for the highest standing in the Faculty of Fine Arts.\nBetween 1980 and 1992, El Salvador was torn apart by a civil war fought between the Salvadorian military dictatorship and a unified leftist opposition guerrilla movement known as the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN). The twelve-year struggle claimed 75,000 lives, left 8,000 more missing and a million each homeless and exiled. Not surprisingly, some of the most compelling images in Lopezdabdoub's body of work deal with war and its toll. Still, the artist is not especially concerned with the concrete and tangible horror of bullets and guns but rather with the effect that, in a metaphysical sense, particular events have in people's psyche. His work is a universal and humanistic form of art that evaluates events according to the consequences they have for the human experience. His paintings are critical visual commentaries on pressing economical, political, cultural and social issues. The voices of the people who inhabit his canvases are denunciatory pointing to the terror and other feelings or emotions associated with existing in dysfunctional and destructive environments.\nJuan's practice spans a diversity of media, including painting, sculpture, photography, digital media and most recently video. Because the subject matter of his work is as important as the form, Juan likes to describe himself as a visual storyteller.", "passages": [{"passageId": "10404:166:267", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "9", "propertyName": "EDUCATED_AT", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the institution where she/he studied."}], "passageStart": 166, "passageEnd": 267, "passageText": "In 1993, he entered the University of Manitoba where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts-Honors degree.", "facts": [{"factId": "10404:175:177:213:218:9", "propertyId": "9", "humanReadable": "<he> <EDUCATED_AT> <where>", "annotatedPassage": "In 1993, <he> entered the University of Manitoba <where> he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts-Honors degree.", "subjectStart": 175, "subjectEnd": 177, "subjectText": "he", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 213, "objectEnd": 218, "objectText": "where", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1191833"}, {"factId": "10404:219:221:213:218:9", "propertyId": "9", "humanReadable": "<he> <EDUCATED_AT> <where>", "annotatedPassage": "In 1993, he entered the University of Manitoba <where> <he> earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts-Honors degree.", "subjectStart": 219, "subjectEnd": 221, "subjectText": "he", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 213, "objectEnd": 218, "objectText": "where", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1191833"}, {"factId": "10404:175:177:190:212:9", "propertyId": "9", "humanReadable": "<he> <EDUCATED_AT> <University of Manitoba>", "annotatedPassage": "In 1993, <he> entered the <University of Manitoba> where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts-Honors degree.", "subjectStart": 175, "subjectEnd": 177, "subjectText": "he", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 190, "objectEnd": 212, "objectText": "University of Manitoba", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1191833"}, {"factId": "10404:219:221:190:212:9", "propertyId": "9", "humanReadable": "<he> <EDUCATED_AT> <University of Manitoba>", "annotatedPassage": "In 1993, he entered the <University of Manitoba> where <he> earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts-Honors degree.", "subjectStart": 219, "subjectEnd": 221, "subjectText": "he", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 190, "objectEnd": 212, "objectText": "University of Manitoba", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1191833"}]}]}

At Columbia University Teachers College, he continued to pursue his interests in the history of science, and particularly the work of Charles Darwin. Gruber's work led to several important discoveries about the creative process and the developmental psychology of creativity. His work on Charles Darwin entitled Darwin on Man: A Psychological Study of Scientific Creativity, became the groundwork of his methodological approach for the case study of evolving systems. This book was awarded Science Book of the Year for 1974 by Phi Beta Kappa. Key aspects of this approach are a radical focus on individuals as situated in a network of enterprise. The method uses a strong existential perspective as regards the \"creative\" individual who is said to act at all times with knowledge, purpose and affect.

Campbell (February 21, 1904 \u2013 June 14, 1963) was an American writer, actor, and screenwriter. He and his wife, Dorothy Parker, were a popular screenwriting team in Hollywood from 1934 to 1963.Born in Richmond, Virginia, he was the only child of Harry L. Campbell and Hortense Eichel Campbell. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute and moved to New York City in the late 1920s. An occasional contributor of prose to The New Yorker, he also acted on the Broadway stage. He met Parker in 1932 and they married two years later in Raton, New Mexico. Like his wife, he was of mixed Scottish and German-Jewish descent. Campbell, Parker, and their collaborator, Robert Carson, earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for the 1937 version of A Star Is Born. He and Parker also wrote additional dialogue for The Little Foxes when Lillian Hellman was called away to work on another project. In 1942 Campbell enlisted in the U.S. Army in Philadelphia. He was commissioned a captain, and served in Army Intelligence in Europe for the duration of World War II. Campbell and Parker divorced in 1947, then remarried in 1950. Although they lived separately from 1952 until 1961, they remained married until Campbell's death. Campbell died of an apparent suicide on June 14, 1963 in West Hollywood, California.

He was an editor for The Jewish Daily Forward and The New York Sun and a leader of the American Jewish Congress. Twerksy was born and raised in the Bronx, New York, where he grew up in the left-leaning Sholem Aleichem cooperative housing project. He attended the Ramaz School in Manhattan and was active in the Labor Zionist youth movement Habonim. He attended City College of New York. In 1974, Twersky made aliyah (emigrated to Israel) and helped to re-establish Kibbutz Gezer. In Israel, Twersky worked for the Labor Party's international affairs department, where he dealt with the Socialist International. He edited Shdemot, the literary journal of the kibbutz movement, and Spectrum, an English-language political monthly. Twersky served in an artillery unit during the 1982 Lebanon War. Twersky returned to the U.S. in 1986 and became a full-time journalist. When the Yiddish Forverts started an English-language edition in 1990, he became deputy editor and Washington bureau chief. During his seven years at The Forward, Twersky was responsible for breaking many news stories. One of his best-known stories involved President Bill Clinton's associate Johnnetta B. Cole, who had been suggested as a possible nominee for Secretary of Education, and the fact that she had served on the national committee of the Venceremos Brigade. Another of Twersky's stories brought to light some views of Lani Guinier, a law professor whom Clinton had nominated to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights; those opinions were considered controversial and her nomination was withdrawn. After leaving The Forward, Twersky became editor of the New Jersey Jewish News. Later he joined The New York Sun as foreign editor and columnist.

In September, 1876, he entered McGill College, Montreal, where he studied for two years, and won first scholarship each year. In September 1878, he won the Canadian Gilchrist scholarship of the value of 100 stg., per annum, tenable for three years and then proceeded to London, England, where he studied at University College, making a specialty to mathematics. In June 1881, he won the Rothschild scholarship of the value of 56, which was awarded for the greatest proficiency in mathematics in University College. He graduated at the University of London in Oct. 1881 and was appointed assistant to the professor of mathematics in University college and held the position for two years.

{"fold": 1, "source": "DBpedia Abstract", "documentId": "21626", "documentText": "Stray (band)\n\nStray is an English hard rock band formed in 1966. Vocalist Steve Gadd (born 27 April 1952, Shepherd's Bush, London), guitarist Del Bromham (born Derek Roy Bromham, 25 November 1951, Acton, London), bass player Gary Giles (born Gary Stephen Giles, 23 February 1952, North Kensington, London) and drummer Steve Crutchley (born c 1952) formed the band whilst all were attending the Christopher Wren School in London. Richard \"Ritchie\" Cole (born 10 November 1951, Shepherd's Bush, London) replaced Crutchley in 1968. They signed to Transatlantic Records in January 1970. The group's brand of melodic, hook-laden hard rock proved to be a popular draw on the local club scene during the early 1970s. However the band did not have commercial success with its record releases. At one stage Charlie Kray (brother of the Kray twins Ronnie and Reggie), was their manager. Gadd left the band in 1975 due to artistic differences and was replaced on vocals by Pete Dyer. The groups early musical style consisted of blues rock, acid rock and psychedelic rock. They then went on to join the hard rock and progressive rock movement. The original Stray finally dissolved in 1977, although Bromham later continued to play in various resurrected versions of the project well into the 2000s.

He was featured in the 1989 dance film Tap, along with Sammy Davis Jr., Gregory Hines and Savion Glover, demonstrating classic challenge dancing.

She studied music at Mills College in Oakland. She became a renowned singer, performing in several European cities. In 1899, she married the opera producer Frank Russak. She was deeply interested in Theosophy and became active in the Theosophical Society. Between 1906 and 1910 she lived in Adyar (Chennai), India, where she deepened her study of esoterism. She participated actively in Co-Masonry, and in 1912 she co-founded the Order of the Temple of the Rosy Cross with Annie Besant. She worked actively with the Rosicrucians until the group was dissolved in 1918. Russak continued to work in the Theosophical Society and was contacted in California by Harvey Spencer Lewis, who in 1915 had founded AMORC. She transmitted much of the esoteric knowledge that she had acquired, and she collaborated with the elaboration of some rituals, which were similar to those made of the OTRC. Marie Russak was also involved in architectural design, and her work can still be seen in Krotona, California. Some of her designs were inspired by Moorish and Mission styles.

Skinner, was an American psychologist, behaviorist, author, inventor, and social philosopher. He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1974. Skinner considered free will an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance that the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, however, the actions that led to it will become more probable. Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement. Skinner called the use of reinforcement to strengthen behavior operant conditioning, and he considered the rate of response to be the most effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning he invented the operant conditioning chamber, also known as the Skinner Box, and to measure rate he invented the cumulative recorder. Using these tools he and C. B. Ferster produced his most influential experimental work, which appeared in the book Schedules of Reinforcement. Skinner developed a philosophy of science that he called radical behaviorism, and founded a school of experimental research psychology\u2014the experimental analysis of behavior. He imagined the application of his ideas to the design of a human community in his utopian novel Walden Two, and his analysis of human behavior culminated in his work Verbal Behavior. Skinner was a prolific author who published 21 books and 180 articles. Contemporary academia considers Skinner a pioneer of modern behaviorism along with John B. Watson and Ivan Pavlov.

However the double-letter system starting with RR was already inwidespread use. As a result, variable stars after QZ were numbered according to Nijland's system beginning with V335.

His positions included membership and chairmanship of the Massachusetts Governor's Council and representative in both the House and Senate. As chairman of the Governor's Council, Dawes served briefly as the de jure presiding officer of the executive branch of Massachusetts' state government for ten days \u2013 May 20, 1800 to May 30, 1800 \u2013 following the death of first Governor Increase Sumner and then Lieutenant Governor Moses Gill. (See List of Governors of Massachusetts.) Dawes was born in Boston. Prior to the Revolution, he attended a regular school and worked as a mechanic. He ardently supported the Whigs, gaining infamy among Royalists; his house was plundered by the British when they withdrew from Boston in 1776. Later, he became active in politics, lived in a roomy house on Purchase Street beside John Adams, and worked as an architect and builder designing many notable buildings in Boston, including the Old Street House and the Brattle Street Church.

The term became widely used during the Chicano Movement, mainly among Mexican Americans within the city of Chicago[citation needed] who wanted to express an identity, of cultural, ethnic and community pride, similarly to the Chicago Polonia. The term \"Chicano\" had negative connotations before the Chicano Movement, and still is viewed negatively by more conservative members of this community, but it over time gained more acceptance as an identity of pride within the Mexican-American community in the United States. Still, many American-born Mexicans view the term to be distracting, as it often represents a refusal to identify with either Mexican or American identities, while Mexicans from Mexico usually aren't familiar with or do not identify with the term.[citation needed] The pro-indigenous/Mestizo nature of Chicano nationalism is cemented in the nature of Mexican national identity, in which the culture is heavily syncretic between indigenous and Spanish cultures, and where 60% of the population is Mestizo, and another 30% are indigenous, with the remaining 10% being of European heritage and others racial/ethnic groups.

The club has won more European and domestic trophies than any other English team with five European Cups, three UEFA Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, 18 League titles, seven FA Cups, a record eight League Cups, and 15 FA Community Shields. The club was founded in 1892 and joined the Football League the following year. The club has played at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in both English and European football during the 1970s and '80s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies. Under the management of Rafa Ben\u00edtez and captained by Steven Gerrard Liverpool re-emerged as European champions once again, winning the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan in spite of being 3\u20130 down at half time. Liverpool was the ninth highest-earning football club in the world for 2013\u201314, with an annual revenue of \u20ac306 million, and the world's eighth most valuable football club in 2015, valued at $982 million. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably the North West Derby against Manchester United and the Merseyside derby with Everton. The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall in the Heysel Stadium, with 39 people\u2014mostly Italians and Juventus fans\u2014losing their lives, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition. The second was the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush against perimeter fencing. The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since.

Dickey in his \"Hawaiian style\" after he finally returned to the islands for good in 1925. It was built in 1926 for Jessie Eyman and Wilma Judson, two nurses who arrived from Illinois in 1925. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The house sits on a sharply triangular hillside lot overlooking Manoa Valley at the intersection of Alani Drive (below) and Paty Drive (above, formerly Dillingham Drive). Its \"Hawaiian style\" architecture includes Dickey's trademark double-pitched hip roof with overhanging eaves, ample windows, and an enclosed lanai at the south-facing entrance. The single-story house, one-room deep, with board-and-batten siding, wraps around an open courtyard in the rear. One wing off the living room contains two bedrooms and a bath. The dining room and kitchen occupy the right rear wing, near a maid's quarters and a garage on the south side. The original owners lived in the house until 1940, when Judson sold her share to Eyman, who sold the house in 1943. As nurses, they set up the first Physicians Telephone Exchange in the Territory. Judson also worked many years for Dr. Forrest Joy Pinkerton, who founded the Blood Bank of Hawai\u02bbi and the Pan-Pacific Surgical Association. Eyman managed the Mabel Smyth Memorial Building from the time it was built in 1941 until she retired in 1952.", "passages": [{"passageId": "29172:1062:1177", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 1062, "passageEnd": 1177, "passageText": "The original owners lived in the house until 1940, when Judson sold her share to Eyman, who sold the house in 1943.", "facts": []}]}

I\u2019m a fully licensed, professional tourist guide since 2006. In Europe, you need a special licence issued by local authorities to work as a tourist guide. I have studied at the Institute of Tourism Studies in Malta, and obtained a Diploma in Marketing from the London Chamber of Commerce Institute in London. I am also a member and sub-committee officer of the Malta Union of Tourist Guides. \n\nDuring the year, I participate in various seminars and events to ensure a continuous professional development in my field, like, for example, \u2018The Maltese Natural Heritage\u2019 course organised by Nature Trust (Malta), which was held at the University of Malta in February 2010.  I speak fluent Maltese, English and Italian, conversant in Spanish, and can understand some French and German. \n\nI have a passion for history, photography and the performing arts, and I collect Melitensia (Maltese History Books).  In my free time, I enjoy relaxing activities such as picnics, camping, treasure hunts and walks with our two dogs. I love planning trips and travelling to other countries as there is so much to see out there! In 2004, I embraced the opportunity of a 3-month work experience in San Francisco (USA), which was beneficial to my personal development.  \n\nMalta\u2019s rich historical heritage covers 7000 years of cultural importance and despite it being such a small country; it offers a multitude of sight-seeing experiences. That is why I strongly suggest you go together with a licensed tourist guide who will help you to get the most from the time you have, understanding your interests and designing the perfect tour to suit your needs. \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to meeting you in Malta! \n\nFor any queries or further information, you may contact me at info@YourMaltaGuide.com. \n\nCharmaine \nYour Malta Guide\nMTA Licence.

{"fold": 4, "source": "DBpedia Abstract", "documentId": "8007", "documentText": "Joy Division\n\nJoy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook, and drummer Stephen Morris. Formed by Sumner and Hook after the two attended a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed the group to his independent label, Factory Records. Joy Division's debut album, Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979 to critical acclaim. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis, who suffered from personal problems that included severe depression, a failing marriage, and epilepsy, found it increasingly difficult to perform at live concerts, during which he occasionally collapsed into seizures. In May 1980, on the eve of the band's first American tour, Curtis, aged 23, committed suicide. The group's second and final album, Closer, was released two months later; the album and preceding single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became the band's highest charting release. After Curtis's death, the remaining members continued as New Order and achieved critical and commercial success. Although their career spanned less than four years, Joy Division have continued to exert a vast influence on a variety of subsequent artists.", "passages": [{"passageId": "8007:256:457", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "9", "propertyName": "EDUCATED_AT", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the institution where she/he studied."}, {"propertyId": "2", "propertyName": "FOUNDED_BY", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between an organization and its founder or co-founder."}, {"propertyId": "6", "propertyName": "HEADQUARTERS", "propertyDescription": "Describes the specific location where an organization's headquarters is or has been situated."}], "passageStart": 256, "passageEnd": 457, "passageText": "Formed by Sumner and Hook after the two attended a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement.", "facts": [{"factId": "8007:324:336:277:281:2", "propertyId": "2", "humanReadable": "<Joy Division> <FOUNDED_BY> <Hook>", "annotatedPassage": "Formed by Sumner and <Hook> after the two attended a Sex Pistols gig, <Joy Division> moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement.", "subjectStart": 324, "subjectEnd": 336, "subjectText": "Joy Division", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172763", "objectStart": 277, "objectEnd": 281, "objectText": "Hook", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q431244"}, {"factId": "8007:324:336:350:355:2", "propertyId": "2", "humanReadable": "<Joy Division> <FOUNDED_BY> <their>", "annotatedPassage": "Formed by Sumner and Hook after the two attended a Sex Pistols gig, <Joy Division> moved beyond <their> punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement.", "subjectStart": 324, "subjectEnd": 336, "subjectText": "Joy Division", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172763", "objectStart": 350, "objectEnd": 355, "objectText": "their", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q82545"}, {"factId": "8007:324:336:406:410:2", "propertyId": "2", "humanReadable": "<Joy Division> <FOUNDED_BY> <them>", "annotatedPassage": "Formed by Sumner and Hook after the two attended a Sex Pistols gig, <Joy Division> moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made <them> one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement.", "subjectStart": 324, "subjectEnd": 336, "subjectText": "Joy Division", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172763", "objectStart": 406, "objectEnd": 410, "objectText": "them", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172763"}, {"factId": "8007:324:336:266:272:2", "propertyId": "2", "humanReadable": "<Joy Division> <FOUNDED_BY> <Sumner>", "annotatedPassage": "Formed by <Sumner> and Hook after the two attended a Sex Pistols gig, <Joy Division> moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement.", "subjectStart": 324, "subjectEnd": 336, "subjectText": "Joy Division", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172763", "objectStart": 266, "objectEnd": 272, "objectText": "Sumner", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q438885"}]}]}

A. Hayek, was an Austrian and British economist and philosopher best known for his defense of classical liberalism. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for his \"pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and ... penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena.\" Hayek was a major social theorist and political philosopher of the twentieth century, and his account of how changing prices communicate information which enables individuals to co-ordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics. Hayek served in World War I and said that his experience in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war led him to his career. Hayek lived in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany and became a British subject in 1938. He spent most of his academic life at the London School of Economics (LSE), the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. In 1984, he was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for his \"services to the study of economics\". He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush.

In 1970, Rosser was appointed Science Faculty Artist at Monash University. She illustrated Peter Bridgewater's The Saltmarsh Plants of Southern Australia and The Mosses of Southern Australia by George Scott and Ilma Grace Stone. In 1974 she was appointed University Botanical Artist, and began the project of painting every Banksia species. The project took over 25 years to complete, and resulted in the publication of a three volume monograph entitled The Banksias, with accompanying text by Alex George. Publication of the final volume in 2000 represented the first time that such a large genus has been entirely painted.

Originally created by Edward E. Simbalist and Wilf K. Backhaus in 1977, Chivalry & Sorcery (C&S) was an early competitor to Dungeons & Dragons. Historically, the two designers of the game were dissatisfied with the lack of realism in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and created the first gaming system derived from it, which they named Chevalier. They intended to present it to Gary Gygax at Gen Con in 1977, but changed their minds once at the Con, where they met Scott Bizar who wrote out a letter of intent. After some final changes to get rid of the last remnants of D&D (e.g. the game contained a table of \"Saving-throws\" similar to D&D), Simbalist and Backhaus published the first edition of their game - now renamed Chivalry & Sorcery - shortly after the release of the first edition of Advanced D&D. According to Michael Tresca, Chivalry & Sorcery \"embraced a realistic approach to medieval France in the 12th century, complete with feudalism and the Catholic Church. Chivalry & Sorcery was most noteworthy for creating the term \"game master.\" It was one of the first games to place the setting at utmost importance over the mechanics of the game.\" More focused on medieval chivalry than fantasy, Chivalry & Sorcery (C&S) had from its first version a sophisticated and complex set of rules. The game has been published four times to improve its presentation and to modernize its game mechanics. C&S was the first to introduce new concepts like levels for monsters.[citation needed] Players could adventure in a variety of locations instead of being confined to a dark underground dungeon. The action taking place outside the framework of an adventure became very important, especially for magicians, who had to spend many days to learn their spells and enchant their materials.", "passages": [{"passageId": "8185:131:274", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 131, "passageEnd": 274, "passageText": "Originally created by Edward E.

Born in Brussels as the second (but eldest surviving) son of Leopold I and Louise of Orl\u00e9ans, he succeeded his father to the throne on 17 December 1865, reigning for exactly 44 years until his death. This was the longest reign of any Belgian monarch. Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used explorer Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884\u20131885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. From the beginning, however, Leopold essentially ignored these conditions. He ran the Congo using the mercenary Force Publique for his personal enrichment. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium. Leopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the natives to harvest and process rubber. Under his regime millions of Congolese people died; modern estimates range from 1 to 15 million, with a consensus growing around 10 million. Human rights abuses under his regime contributed significantly to these deaths. Reports of deaths and abuse led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and Leopold was ultimately forced by the Belgian government to relinquish control of the colony to the civil

Boyle left Newfoundland for Montreal, Quebec in the Dominion of Canada where he trained at McGill University under Nobel Prize winner Sir Ernest Rutherford, in the then fledgling field of radioactivity. He earned McGill's first Doctor of Philosophy in physics in 1909. He then moved to England to continue his work by following Rutherford to the University of Manchester. In 1912 he returned to Canada at the request of Henry Marshall Tory to become head of the physics department at the University of Alberta, and shifted his research to ultrasonics. During the First Great War Boyle volunteered his expertise to the British Admiralty and, with the help of his old teacher Ernest Rutherford, he joined the Board of Inventions and Research and worked with British physicist Albert Beaumont Wood, a fellow student of Rutherford's. Before 1917 the scientific teams from the Allied countries worked separately, however, after joining forces with French researchers, Boyle produced a working prototype of what the British called \"ASDIC\" (the first sonar). Early versions of the technology were being installed on Royal Navy war ships just as the war came to an end. In 1919 Boyle returned to Alberta and shortly thereafter became dean of the Faculty of Applied Science, a position he held until 1929. That year he joined the National Research Council of Canada as the director of physics, where he supervised research into radar during the Second World War. He continued to work at the National Research Council until his retirement in 1948, when he moved back to England. He was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1921 and awarded the Flavelle Medal in 1940. He died in London, England, aged 71.", "passages": [{"passageId": "8324:168:236", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "15", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_BIRTH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of birth of a person."}], "passageStart": 168, "passageEnd": 236, "passageText": "Boyle was born in 1883 at Carbonear in the Dominion of Newfoundland.", "facts": [{"factId": "8324:168:173:186:190:15", "propertyId": "15", "humanReadable": "<Boyle> <DATE_OF_BIRTH> <1883>", "annotatedPassage": "<Boyle> was born in <1883> at Carbonear in the Dominion of Newfoundland.", "subjectStart": 168, "subjectEnd": 173, "subjectText": "Boyle", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3436560", "objectStart": 186, "objectEnd": 190, "objectText": "1883", "objectUri": ""}]}]}

I was mainly in charge of business development with public-sector clients located in the Gulf States, the Middle East, Africa, Caucasia and Central Asia, and with key private multinational clients. My responsibilities also included interfacing with international funding agencies.\nSince August 2015 I have been acting as Managing Director of the Water & Solid Waste International Activities Business Unit - Artelia Ville & Transport (AVT).

He rejected certain common Muslim practices which he regarded as amounting to either religious innovation (bid\u2018ah) or polytheism (shirk).[citation needed] Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's pact with Muhammad bin Saud helped to establish the Emirate of Diriyah, the first Saudi state, and began a dynastic alliance and power-sharing arrangement between their families which continues to the present day in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Al ash-Sheikh, Saudi Arabia's leading religious family, are the descendants of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab, and have historically led the ulama in the Saudi state, dominating the state's clerical institutions. His movement is today often known as \"Wahhabism\", although many adherents see this as a derogatory term coined by his opponents, and prefer it to be known as the Salafi movement. Many scholars claim that Salafism is a term applicable to several forms of puritanical Islam in various parts of the world, while Wahhabism refers to the specific Saudi school, which is seen as a more strict form of Salafism. According to Ahmad Moussalli, professor of political science at the American University of Beirut, \"As a rule, all Wahhabis are Salafists, but not all Salafists are Wahhabis\".

Following record-shattering performances by Chinese female swimmers in the 1990s and a doping scandal during the 1998 Tour de France, international sport created the World Anti-Doping Agency, effectively removing control of drug testing from the IOC and Merode. In 1998, Merode backed up claims that certain athletes were using the controversial abortion doping procedure for performance-enhancing benefits; however, he did not provide any proof.
